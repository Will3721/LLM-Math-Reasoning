"First, let's calculate the number of apples produced in each season:

1. **First Season:** The tree produced 200 apples.

2. **Second Season:** The tree produced 20% fewer apples than in the first season.  
   - 20% of 200 apples is \( \frac{20}{100} \times 200 = 40 \) apples.  
   - Therefore, the tree produced \( 200 - 40 = 160 \) apples in the second season.

3. **Third Season:** The apple production doubled from the second season.  
   - Double of 160 apples is \( 160 \times 2 = 320 \) apples.

Now, add up the apples produced over the three seasons:
- First Season: 200 apples
- Second Season: 160 apples
- Third Season: 320 apples

"To determine how many trees Holly needs to plant along her 25-yard fence, we first need to convert the fence length from yards to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard:

\[ 25 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 75 \text{ feet} \]

Each tree measures 1.5 feet wide at maturity. Therefore, to cover 75 feet with these trees, you divide the total length by the width of each tree:

\[ \frac{75 \text{ feet}}{1.5 \text{ feet/tree}} = 50 \text{ trees} \]

Each tree costs $8.00, so the total cost of the trees is:

\[ 50 \text{ trees} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tree} = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, it will cost Holly $400 to plant a row of trees to run the length of her fence.",400.0
"Since the marathon is circular, it covers a total of 26 miles. The first checkpoint is one mile from the start line, and the last checkpoint is one mile from the finish line, meaning they are not counted towards the spacing between the checkpoints.

The marathon route has four checkpoints overall with equal spacing. Let's denote the spacing between consecutive checkpoints as ""x"" miles. We have the following setup for the checkpoints:

- The first checkpoint is at 1 mile.
- The subsequent checkpoints are at 1 + x, 1 + 2x, and 1 + 3x miles.
- The last checkpoint is at 26 - 1 = 25 miles (1 mile before the finish).

Since the checkpoints are equally spaced, solve for ""x"":

"First, let's calculate the number of t-shirts Tom buys. Since he buys 5 t-shirts from each of his 4 favorite fandoms, he buys:

\[ 5 \text{ t-shirts/fandom} \times 4 \text{ fandoms} = 20 \text{ t-shirts} \]

Next, calculate the cost per t-shirt with the 20% discount. The original price is $15, so with a 20% discount:

Discount amount per t-shirt is \( 15 \times 0.20 = 3 \)

Discounted price per t-shirt is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \)

Now, calculate the total cost for 20 t-shirts at the discounted price:

\[ 20 \text{ t-shirts} \times 12 \text{ dollars/t-shirt} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Tom still needs to pay a 10% tax on the total price of $240. Calculate the tax amount:

\[ 240 \times 0.10 = 24 \]

Finally, add the tax to the total discounted price to find the final amount Tom pays:

\[ 240 + 24 = 264 \]

Tom pays $264 in total.",264.0
"First, calculate the total cost of the pills without insurance for a 30-day month. John takes 2 pills a day, and each pill costs $1.50, so:

2 pills/day * $1.50/pill = $3.00/day

For 30 days:

$3.00/day * 30 days = $90.00

Next, calculate the amount covered by insurance. The insurance covers 40% of the cost:

40% of $90.00 = 0.40 * $90.00 = $36.00

Subtract the covered amount from the total cost to find out how much John pays:

$90.00 - $36.00 = $54.00

Therefore, John pays $54.00 in a 30-day month.",30.0
"First, calculate Jake's swimming speed. If it takes him 20 minutes to swim 1 mile, then his swimming speed is 1 mile per 20 minutes. Convert this to miles per hour:

\[
1 \text{ mile per } 20 \text{ minutes} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{3} \text{ hour}} = 3 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Since Jake can row at twice his swimming speed, his rowing speed is:

\[
2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, calculate the total distance around the lake. Since each side of the square lake is 15 miles, the perimeter (total rowing distance) is:

\[
4 \times 15 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, find how long it takes Jake to row around the lake at 6 miles per hour:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it takes Jake 10 hours to row around the lake.",10.0
"Let's denote the number of tickets Taegan won from each game as \( x \). Since there are 5 games and she won an equal number of tickets from each game, the total number of tickets she won from all the games is \( 5x \).

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( S \) be the price of one shirt and \( P \) be the price of one pair of pants.

2. **Initial Purchase Equation:**
   You bought 2 shirts and 3 pairs of pants for a total of $120. Therefore, the equation is:
   \[
   2S + 3P = 120
   \]

3. **Refund Calculation:**
   When you returned all 3 pairs of pants, you were refunded 25% of the original payment. Since the total payment was $120, 25% of $120 is:
   \[
   0.25 \times 120 = 30
   \]
   So, you were refunded $30 for the return of 3 pairs of pants.

4. **Equation for Refund:**
   Since returning the pants refunded you $30, the equation for the pants is:
   \[
   3P = 30
   \]

5. **Price of Pants:**
   Solving for \( P \) gives:
   \[
   P = \frac{30}{3} = 10
   \]

6. **Substitute and Find Shirt Price:**
   Substitute \( P = 10 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2S + 3(10) = 120
   \]
   \[
   2S + 30 = 120

7. **Solve for \( S \):**
   \[
   2S = 120 - 30
   \]
   \[
   2S = 90

   \[
   S = \frac{90}{2} = 45

"First, we need to find out how many eggs Tricia has initially. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Tricia ordered three dozen eggs, which is:

3 dozen × 12 eggs/dozen = 36 eggs

Tricia will use 1/4 of these eggs to make crepes. So, the number of eggs used for crepes is:

1/4 of 36 = 36 × 1/4 = 9 eggs

After using 9 eggs for crepes, Tricia has:

36 - 9 = 27 eggs remaining

Next, she will use 2/3 of the remaining eggs for making cupcakes:

2/3 of 27 = 27 × 2/3 = 18 eggs

After using 18 eggs for cupcakes, the number of eggs left for making sunny-side-up eggs is:

27 - 18 = 9 eggs

So, Tricia has 9 eggs left to make sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast.",9.0

"To find the total number of toes on the Popton school bus, we need to calculate the number of toes for both the Hoopit and Neglart students and then add them together.

First, we'll calculate the number of toes per Hoopit:
- Each Hoopit has 4 hands.
- Each hand has 3 toes.
- Therefore, each Hoopit has \(4 \times 3 = 12\) toes.

Since there are 7 Hoopit students on the bus:
- The total number of toes for Hoopits is \(7 \times 12 = 84\) toes.

Next, we'll calculate the number of toes per Neglart:
- Each Neglart has 5 hands.
- Each hand has 2 toes.
- Therefore, each Neglart has \(5 \times 2 = 10\) toes.

Since there are 8 Neglart students on the bus:
- The total number of toes for Neglarts is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toes.

Adding the total toes from both races:

"To determine how many weeks 546 buckets of fish will last, we first need to calculate the total number of buckets of fish used by all the animals in one day.

1. **Sharks**: 4 buckets per day.
2. **Dolphins**: Sharks are fed 4 buckets, so dolphins are fed half as many: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \) buckets per day.
3. **Other sea animals**: Sharks are fed 4 buckets, so the other sea animals are fed five times as many: \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) buckets per day.

Now, add up the buckets used by each group of animals in one day:
\[ 4 \, (\text{sharks}) + 2 \, (\text{dolphins}) + 20 \, (\text{other sea animals}) = 26 \text{ buckets per day} \]

"First, calculate the revenue from selling 5000 widgets. Jenna sells each widget for $8, so her total revenue is:

\[ 5000 \times 8 = 40,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the cost of purchasing the widgets. Jenna pays $3 for each widget, so her cost for 5000 widgets is:

\[ 5000 \times 3 = 15,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, calculate her total profit before deducting additional expenses like rent, wages, and taxes. Subtract the cost of widgets from the revenue:

\[ 40,000 - 15,000 = 25,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total amount Jenna pays her workers every month. She pays each of the four workers $2,500, so:

"To find out how much more profit is made by spending the extra money to build the certain house, we need to calculate the profit for both the certain house and the other houses.

1. **Calculate the construction cost for the other houses:**
   - Let the construction cost for the other houses be \( C \).
   - Selling price for the other houses is $320,000.

2. **Calculate the cost of building the certain house:**
   - Cost of the certain house = \( C + 100,000 \).

3. **Calculate the selling price for the certain house:**
   - Selling price for the certain house = 1.5 times the selling price of the other houses.
   - Selling price for the certain house = \( 1.5 \times 320,000 = 480,000 \).

4. **Calculate the profit for the other houses:**
   - Profit for other houses = Selling price - Construction cost = \( 320,000 - C \).

5. **Calculate the profit for the certain house:**
   - Profit for the certain house = Selling price - Construction cost = \( 480,000 - (C + 100,000) \).
   - Simplifying gives \( 480,000 - C - 100,000 = 380,000 - C \).

6. **Calculate the additional profit made by the certain house:**
   - Additional profit = Profit for the certain house - Profit for the other houses.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Michael and his oldest brother, given that the age of the younger brother is already known.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. We are given that Michael's younger brother is 5 years old.
   
2. The younger brother's age is also given as one-third of the age of the oldest brother. So, the equation for the oldest brother's age is:

3. Now, we know that the oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. Let's denote Michael's current age as \( M \).

   - A year ago, Michael's age was \( M - 1 \).
   - Twice this age would be \( 2(M - 1) = 2M - 2 \).
   - The oldest brother's age then becomes \( (2M - 2) + 1 = 2M - 1 \).

4. We also found that the oldest brother is 15 years old, so we set up the equation:

"First, calculate the total number of people present to receive a cupcake. There are 27 students in the class, but 3 students are absent due to illness, leaving 24 students present. Additionally, there is 1 teacher and 1 teacher's aide, resulting in a total of:

24 (students) + 1 (teacher) + 1 (teacher's aide) = 26 people

Dani brought two and a half dozen cupcakes. Since one dozen equals 12, two and a half dozen equals:

2.5 × 12 = 30 cupcakes

Dani distributes one cupcake to each of the 26 people, which results in:

30 cupcakes - 26 people = 4 cupcakes remaining

Thus, after giving one cupcake to everyone present, 4 cupcakes are left.",4.0
"Jerry had a total of 63 pieces of candy that he divided equally into 9 bags. This means each bag contained:

\[ \frac{63}{9} = 7 \text{ pieces of candy} \text{ per bag}. \]

Now, we need to determine how many bags were not chocolate and then calculate how many pieces of candy they contained. According to the problem, 2 bags contained chocolate hearts and 3 bags contained chocolate kisses, totaling:

\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ chocolate bags}. \]

Therefore, the remaining bags were not chocolate. The number of non-chocolate bags is:

\[ 9 - 5 = 4 \text{ non-chocolate bags}. \]

Each of these 4 non-chocolate bags contains 7 pieces of candy, so the number of pieces of candy that were not chocolate is:

The answer is 28.",28.0
"To determine how many nuts Maria needs, we first need to calculate the number of cookies in each category.

1. **Cookies with only nuts:**  
   Sally wants 1/4 of the cookies to have nuts.  
   \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) cookies will have only nuts.

2. **Cookies with only chocolate chips:**  
   Sally wants 40% of the cookies to have chocolate chips.  
   \( 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \) cookies will have only chocolate chips.

3. **Cookies with both nuts and chocolate chips:**  
   The remainder of the cookies will have both nuts and chocolate chips.  
   Total cookies = 60.  
   Cookies with only nuts + cookies with only chocolate chips = 15 + 24 = 39.  
   Cookies with both nuts and chocolate chips = 60 - 39 = 21 cookies.

Now, calculate the number of nuts needed:

- Each cookie with nuts requires 2 nuts.

4. **Nuts needed for cookies with only nuts:**  
   15 cookies \(\times\) 2 nuts per cookie = 30 nuts.

5. **Nuts needed for cookies with both nuts and chocolate chips:**  
   21 cookies \(\times\) 2 nuts per cookie = 42 nuts.

Finally, calculate the total number of nuts needed:

"To calculate how much Sol earns in a week, we need to determine how many candy bars she sells each day over six days and then multiply by the cost per candy bar.

- **Day 1**: She sells 10 candy bars.
- **Day 2**: She sells 4 more than Day 1, so 10 + 4 = 14 candy bars.
- **Day 3**: She sells 4 more than Day 2, so 14 + 4 = 18 candy bars.
- **Day 4**: She sells 4 more than Day 3, so 18 + 4 = 22 candy bars.
- **Day 5**: She sells 4 more than Day 4, so 22 + 4 = 26 candy bars.
- **Day 6**: She sells 4 more than Day 5, so 26 + 4 = 30 candy bars.

Now, add up all the candy bars sold throughout the week:

10 (Day 1) + 14 (Day 2) + 18 (Day 3) + 22 (Day 4) + 26 (Day 5) + 30 (Day 6) = 120 candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 10 cents, and there are 100 cents in a dollar, so we convert the total earnings from cents to dollars:

120 candy bars * 10 cents/candy bar = 1200 cents.

1200 cents / 100 = 12 dollars.

25 cents to Peter + 50 cents to Randi = 75 cents.

Ray originally has 95 cents. After giving away 75 cents, Ray has:
95 - 75 = 20 cents left.

Since Ray started with nickels and 1 nickel is worth 5 cents, we need to find out how many nickels are left.

To find the percentage of animals that are monkeys, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage of monkeys} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of monkeys}}{\text{Total number of animals}}\right) \times 100\%

"To find Julie's monthly salary, we first need to calculate her weekly earnings and then account for the week where she missed a day of work.

1. Calculate her daily earnings when she works 8 hours:
   \[
   \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours per Day} = 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate her regular weekly earnings (6 days work):
   \[
   \text{Weekly Earnings (6 days)} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times 6 \, \text{days} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \times 6 = 240 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. For the week she missed a day of work, she worked 5 days instead of 6:
   \[
   \text{Weekly Earnings (5 days)} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \times 5 = 200 \, \text{dollars}

4. Calculate her monthly salary after missing a day (assuming 4-week month):
   - Normally she'd earn 240 dollars each week, so for 3 weeks: 
     \[
     240 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 720 \, \text{dollars}

   \[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \, \text{snails} \]

The total number of snails found by the first two groups of ducklings is:  
\[ 15 + 27 = 42 \, \text{snails} \]

3. The mother duck finds three times the total number of snails as the first two groups:

Since there are 2 remaining ducklings, they find:  
\[ 2 \times 63 = 126 \, \text{snails} \]

Finally, the total number of snails found by the family of ducks is:

Thus, the family of ducks collectively has 294 snails.",294.0
"To find out how many hours it takes the dog groomer to dry all the dogs, we'll first calculate the time taken for each type of dog, and then sum them up.

1. **Short-haired dogs:**
   - It takes 10 minutes to dry one short-haired dog.
   - He has 6 short-haired dogs to dry.
   - Time for short-haired dogs = 6 dogs × 10 minutes/dog = 60 minutes.

2. **Full-haired dogs:**
   - It takes twice as long to dry a full-haired dog compared to a short-haired dog, so it takes 2 × 10 = 20 minutes to dry one full-haired dog.
   - He has 9 full-haired dogs to dry.
   - Time for full-haired dogs = 9 dogs × 20 minutes/dog = 180 minutes.

1. James buys two pairs of shoes, one for $40 and another for $60. According to the offer, he gets the cheaper pair ($40) for half off. So, the discount on the $40 shoes is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]

2. Therefore, James pays $20 for the $40 pair and the full $60 for the second pair:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80
   \]

3. James receives an extra discount of a fourth off the total amount. First calculate a fourth of $80:
   \[
   \frac{80}{4} = 20
   \]

4. Subtract this discount from the total amount:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60

So, James ends up paying $60 for both pairs of shoes.",60.0
"First, determine how many words Lily types in one 10-minute cycle, including the break. Lily types for 10 minutes but takes a 2-minute break, so she types for 8 minutes:

15 words/minute × 8 minutes = 120 words per 10-minute cycle.

Now, calculate how many complete 10-minute cycles Lily needs to type 255 words:

255 words ÷ 120 words per cycle = 2 complete cycles with 15 words remaining.

Two complete cycles take 20 minutes (2 × 10 minutes). In those cycles, Lily types 240 words (120 × 2).

Lily still needs to type 15 more words:

15 words ÷ 15 words/minute = 1 minute.

Adding the time required for the remaining 15 words, the total time is:

20 minutes + 1 minute = 21 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Lily 21 minutes to type 255 words.",255.0

"To find how much Adam's father will have after 2 and a half years, we need to calculate the interest he earns over this period and add it to his original deposit.

1. **Annual Interest Calculation**:  
   - The annual interest rate is 8%.
   - The initial deposit is $2000.
   - Annual interest = 8% of $2000 = 0.08 × $2000 = $160 per year.

"To find out how many hours Steve spends with his family, we first need to determine the total fraction of the day he spends on sleeping, school, and making assignments. Then, we'll subtract that from the whole day.

1. Sleeping: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the day
2. School: \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the day
3. Assignments: \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the day

The least common multiple of 3, 6, and 12 is 12, so let's convert all the fractions to have a denominator of 12:

- Sleeping: \( \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12} \)
- School: \( \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{12} \)
- Assignments: \( \frac{1}{12} \)

Now sum these fractions:

\[
\frac{4}{12} + \frac{2}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{7}{12}
\]

So, Steve spends \( \frac{7}{12} \) of the day sleeping, in school, and on assignments.

The remaining time is: 

\[
1 - \frac{7}{12} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the time Steve spends with his family is:

\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 24 = 10 \text{ hours}

"To determine how many lilies Martha will put in each centerpiece, we first need to understand how many roses and orchids are in each centerpiece and how much they cost.

1. **Calculate the number of roses**:
   - Each centerpiece uses 8 roses.

2. **Calculate the number of orchids**:
   - Each centerpiece uses twice as many orchids as roses.
   - Therefore, each centerpiece uses \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) orchids.

3. **Calculate the cost for roses and orchids per centerpiece**:
   - Each rose costs $15, so the cost for roses in one centerpiece is \( 8 \times 15 = 120 \) dollars.
   - Each orchid also costs $15, so the cost for orchids in one centerpiece is \( 16 \times 15 = 240 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for roses and orchids per centerpiece**:
   - The total cost for roses and orchids per centerpiece is \( 120 + 240 = 360 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total budget for all centerpieces**:
   - Martha's total budget is $2700.

6. **Calculate the total cost for roses and orchids for all centerpieces**:
   - There are 6 centerpieces, so the cost for roses and orchids for all centerpieces is \( 6 \times 360 = 2160 \) dollars.

7. **Calculate the remaining budget for lilies**:
   - The remaining budget for lilies is \( 2700 - 2160 = 540 \) dollars.

8. **Determine how many lilies she can buy with the remaining budget**:
   - Each lily costs $15, so the number of lilies that can be purchased is \( \frac{540}{15} = 36 \) lilies.

9. **Calculate the number of lilies per centerpiece**:
   - If 36 lilies need to be distributed equally among 6 centerpieces, then each centerpiece will have \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) lilies.

Therefore, Martha will put 6 lilies in each centerpiece.",6.0

"First, let's calculate how much total air Kate needs to fill all 52 balloons. Each balloon holds 5 gallons of air, so:

52 balloons × 5 gallons per balloon = 260 gallons of air

Next, we'll determine how much air she fills at each stage of her process:

1. For the first 10 minutes, she fills at a rate of 8 gallons per minute:

10 minutes × 8 gallons per minute = 80 gallons

2. For the next 5 minutes, she fills at half the initial rate, which is 4 gallons per minute:

5 minutes × 4 gallons per minute = 20 gallons

At this point, she has filled:

80 gallons + 20 gallons = 100 gallons

3. She needs to fill a total of 260 gallons, so she has 260 - 100 = 160 gallons left to fill. 

Now, she'll fill at a rate of 2 gallons per minute for the remaining air:

160 gallons ÷ 2 gallons per minute = 80 minutes

Finally, we'll add up all the time she has spent:

10 minutes (first stage) + 5 minutes (second stage) + 80 minutes (third stage) = 95 minutes

2. **Second Day:**
   - It rained twice as much as the first day, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) inches.
   - With the drainage of 3 inches, the net rain added is \(20 - 3 = 17\) inches.

3. **Third Day:**
   - It rained 50% more than the second day, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) inches.
   - With the drainage of 3 inches, the net rain added is \(30 - 3 = 27\) inches.

Now, we add up the net rain accumulated over the first three days:
\[
7 + 17 + 27 = 51 \text{ inches}
\]

The area can hold up to 6 feet of rain before overflowing, which is equivalent to \(6 \times 12 = 72\) inches.

By the end of the third day, the reservoir already has 51 inches of rain. On the fourth day, it overflowed before any drainage could occur. Therefore, the amount of rain on the fourth day that caused the overflow is the minimum amount required to reach 72 inches.

\[
72 - 51 = 21 \text{ inches}
\]

On the fourth day, it rained a minimum of 21 inches to cause overflow.",21.0
"First, let's break down the costs and payments involved.

1. **Total Medical Expenses**: $128
2. **Couple's Share of Medical Expenses**: They decided to pay half of the medical expenses, so they will cover $128 / 2 = $64.

Now, considering the house help's salary:

1. **House Help's Salary**: $160
2. **Deduction from Salary for Medical Expenses**: The other half of the medical expenses, $64, will be deducted from her salary.

This means her adjusted salary is $160 - $64 = $96.

The couple agrees to split all expenses equally, including the adjusted salary and their share of the medical expenses:

1. **Total Expenses Covered by the Couple**: Adjusted salary ($96) + their share of medical expenses ($64) = $160.

2. **Each Person's Share**: Total expenses ($160) divided by 2 people = $160 / 2 = $80.

Since the husband already paid the entire $64 for the medical expenses:

1. **Husband's Current Contribution**: $64
2. **Husband's Share of Total Expenses**: $80

Therefore, the husband still needs to pay $80 - $64 = $16 to equally split the expenses for the house help.",16.0

To save up $400 during the months he's not playing baseball, we need to consider the time available:

- A year has 12 months.
- He spends 4 months playing baseball, so he has 12 months - 4 months = 8 months available to save up.

Gerald charges $10 for each chore. To save $400, he needs to perform:

"To determine the total time taken for grooming the cat, we need to calculate the time spent clipping the nails, cleaning the ears, and shampooing.

1. **Clipping the Nails:**
   - There are four claws on each foot.
   - If the cat has four feet, then the total number of claws is 4 claws/foot × 4 feet = 16 claws.
   - It takes 10 seconds to clip each claw.
   - Therefore, the total time for clipping nails is 16 claws × 10 seconds/claw = 160 seconds.

2. **Cleaning the Ears:**
   - It takes 90 seconds to clean each ear.
   - Since most cats have two ears, the total time for cleaning ears is 2 ears × 90 seconds/ear = 180 seconds.

3. **Shampooing:**
   - It takes 5 minutes to shampoo the cat.
   - Since 1 minute is equivalent to 60 seconds, 5 minutes is 5 × 60 = 300 seconds.

**Total Grooming Time:**

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Shelly originally had 50 candies left in the bowl after eating 20 candies. This means she originally had 50 + 20 = 70 candies.

2. Her friend brings twice as much candy as Shelly originally had:
   - Twice the original amount Shelly had is 70 * 2 = 140 candies.

3. Shelly's friend adds those 140 candies to the bowl, so now they have:
   - 50 (remaining candies) + 140 (friend's candies) = 190 candies in total.

4. They divide the candies equally, so each gets:
   - 190 candies / 2 = 95 candies each.

5. If her friend had eaten 10 of her candies, she would have:
   - 95 - 10 = 85 candies.

So, after eating 10 of her candies, Shelly's friend has 85 candies.",85.0

"First, let's determine the total number of servings Brian needs to prepare. There are eight people in total: Brian, his wife, his two kids, his parents, and his wife's parents. Each person is expected to eat 2 servings, so the total number of servings is:

8 people × 2 servings per person = 16 servings.

According to the recipe, each serving requires 1/2 a cup of milk. Therefore, the total amount of milk required is:

16 servings × 1/2 cup of milk per serving = 8 cups of milk.

Since one US cup equals 250 ml, we convert the total milk needed from cups to milliliters:

8 cups × 250 ml per cup = 2000 ml of milk.

Now, we need to determine how many 1-liter (1000 ml) cartons of milk Brian needs to buy:

2000 ml ÷ 1000 ml per carton = 2 cartons of milk.

"To find the daily average rain total for the week, let's first calculate how much it rained each day from Monday to Friday:

- Monday: 2 inches in the morning and 1 more inch later, so 2 + 1 = 3 inches.
- Tuesday: It rained twice the amount of Monday, so 2 × 3 = 6 inches.
- Wednesday: 0 inches (it did not rain).
- Thursday: 1 inch.
- Friday: The total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined. So, we need to sum the rain from Monday to Thursday: 3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 0 (Wednesday) + 1 (Thursday) = 10 inches. Therefore, it rained 10 inches on Friday.

Now, add up the total rainfall for the week:

- Total rain = 3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 0 (Wednesday) + 1 (Thursday) + 10 (Friday) = 20 inches.

The week has 7 days, so the average rainfall per day is:

1. **Determine how many men tripped and were unable to finish:**
   - There are 80 men in the race.
   - 1/4 of the men tripped, so \( \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \) men tripped.
   - Thus, 80 - 20 = 60 men were left in the race after the tripping incident.

2. **Determine how many men were dehydrated:**
   - 2/3 of the remaining men (60) were dehydrated.
   - So, \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) men were dehydrated.

3. **Determine how many dehydrated men couldn't finish:**
   - 1/5 of these dehydrated men couldn't finish.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{5} \times 40 = 8 \) dehydrated men couldn't finish.

4. **Calculate how many men finished the race:**
   - Total dehydrated men who couldn't finish: 8
   - Total men who initially tripped and couldn't finish: 20
   - So, the total number of men who couldn't finish is 20 + 8 = 28.

5. **Find the total number of men who finished the race:**
   - Out of the 80 men, 28 men couldn't finish, so 80 - 28 = 52 men finished the race.

The answer is 52 men finished the race.",52.0
"Tom receives 10 points for each enemy he kills. If he kills 150 enemies, his base score is 150 enemies × 10 points/enemy = 1500 points.

Since he killed at least 100 enemies, he receives a 50% bonus to his score. The bonus is calculated as 50% of 1500 points = 0.5 × 1500 = 750 points.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Rick bought guppies**:
   - Rick bought 30 guppies.

2. **Tim bought clowns**:
   - Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies.
   - Therefore, Tim bought \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) clowns.

3. **You bought tetras**:
   - You bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns.
   - Therefore, you bought \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) tetras.

4. **Total number of animals purchased**:
   - Rick bought 30 guppies.
   - Tim bought 60 clowns.
   - You bought 240 tetras.

The answer is 330 animals.",330.0
"Kyle spends a total of 2 hours at basketball practice each day, which is 120 minutes. He divides his time equally between shooting and the rest, so he spends 120/2 = 60 minutes on shooting. This means he also spends 60 minutes running and weightlifting combined.

Let's denote the time Kyle spends weightlifting as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, Kyle runs for twice the time he spends weightlifting, which means he runs for \( 2x \) minutes.

The equation for the time spent running and weightlifting is:
\[ x + 2x = 60 \]

Simplify:
\[ 3x = 60 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jenny's Collection:**
   - Red marbles: 30
   - Blue marbles: 25

2. **Mary's Collection:**
   - Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) red marbles.
   - Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie.

3. **Anie's Collection:**
   - Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so Anie collected \( 60 + 20 = 80 \) red marbles.
   - Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, so Anie collected \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) blue marbles.

4. **Mary's Blue Marbles:**
   - Since Mary collected half the number of blue marbles that Anie did, Mary collected \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) blue marbles.

Finally, we calculate the total number of blue marbles collected by all three together:

- Jenny's blue marbles: 25
- Mary's blue marbles: 25
- Anie's blue marbles: 50

The total number of blue marbles collected by the friends is \( 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 \).

"First, let's determine the length of the lake. The boat is traveling at 10 MPH and it takes 2 hours to go across the length, so the length of the lake is:

\[
10 \text{ MPH} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, let's determine the width of the lake. The boat travels the whole width of the lake at the same speed of 10 MPH, and it takes 30 minutes (or 0.5 hours), so the width of the lake is:

\[
10 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ miles}

"To determine the total number of boxes the organization can pack, we first need to calculate the initial amount they planned to spend and then determine how much additional money they received from the donor.

Initially, the organization plans to pack 400 boxes. Each box contains:

- $80 worth of food
- $165 worth of additional supplies

The total cost per box is $80 + $165 = $245.

The initial planned expenditure for 400 boxes is 400 boxes × $245 per box = $98,000.

The anonymous donor gives the organization 4 times this initial amount:

4 × $98,000 = $392,000.

So, the total amount of money available to the organization after the donation is $98,000 (initial) + $392,000 (donation) = $490,000.

Now, we determine how many boxes the organization can pack with this total amount:

Total money available: $490,000

"Let's denote the initial amount of money Susan had as \( x \).

1. In September, Susan spent \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her total money:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent in September} = \frac{x}{5}
   \]

2. In October, Susan spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of her total money:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent in October} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

3. In November, she spent $120.

After all these expenditures, she had $540 left. So the equation representing the situation is:
\[
x - \left(\frac{x}{5} + \frac{x}{4} + 120\right) = 540
\]

Let's solve this equation.

First, find a common denominator for the fractions:
- The common denominator of 5 and 4 is 20.

Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{x}{5} = \frac{4x}{20} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{x}{4} = \frac{5x}{20}
\]

Now substitute these into the equation:
\[
x - \left(\frac{4x}{20} + \frac{5x}{20} + 120\right) = 540
\]

Combine the fractions:
\[
x - \left(\frac{9x}{20} + 120\right) = 540
\]

Distribute the subtraction:
\[
x - \frac{9x}{20} - 120 = 540
\]

Combine \( x \) and \( \frac{9x}{20} \):
\[
\frac{20x}{20} - \frac{9x}{20} - 120 = 540
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{11x}{20} - 120 = 540
\]

Add 120 to both sides:
\[
\frac{11x}{20} = 660
\]

Multiply both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):
\[
11x = 13200

Divide both sides by 11:
\[
x = 1200

Therefore, Susan initially had $1200.",1200.0
"To solve this problem, we'll first determine the numbers of red and yellow flowers, and then find the combined number of pink and purple flowers.

1. **Orange Flowers**: There are 10 orange flowers.

2. **Red Flowers**: The problem states there are twice as many red flowers as orange flowers. Therefore, there are \(2 \times 10 = 20\) red flowers.

3. **Yellow Flowers**: There are five fewer yellow flowers than red flowers. So, there are \(20 - 5 = 15\) yellow flowers.

Now, we know the number of orange, red, and yellow flowers. We can calculate how many pink and purple flowers there are in total as follows:

- Total number of flowers = 105
- Orange flowers = 10
- Red flowers = 20
- Yellow flowers = 15

The combined number of orange, red, and yellow flowers is:

\[ 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 \]

Since the total number of flowers is 105, the number of pink and purple flowers together is:

\[ 105 - 45 = 60 \]

The problem states that pink and purple flowers have the same amount. Thus, the number of each is:

"To find the total number of chips, we can start by understanding that the 3 blue chips make up 10% of the entire collection. This means:

\[ \text{Total number of chips} = \frac{3}{0.1} = 30 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we know that 50% of the chips are white:

\[ \text{Number of white chips} = 0.5 \times 30 = 15 \text{ chips} \]

Since the rest of the chips are green, we can calculate the number of green chips like this:

\[ \text{Number of green chips} = \text{Total number of chips} - (\text{Number of blue chips} + \text{Number of white chips}) \]

\[ \text{Number of green chips} = 30 - (3 + 15) = 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ chips} \]

Therefore, there are 12 green chips.",12.0

"First, let's determine how many crayons Nori initially had. If she had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box, then she had:

4 boxes × 8 crayons per box = 32 crayons initially.

Nori gave 5 crayons to Mae and is now left with 15 crayons. Let's find out how many crayons she gave away:

Crayons given away = Initial crayons - Crayons left 
Crayons given away = 32 - 15 = 17 crayons

Now, we know she gave 5 crayons to Mae. Let \( x \) be the number of crayons she gave to Lea. We have:

5 + \( x \) = 17

Solving for \( x \):

\( x \) = 17 - 5 
\( x \) = 12

Thus, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea. Now we find out how many more crayons she gave to Lea than Mae:

Difference = 12 - 5 = 7

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many days are represented by four-fifths of the 30 days. 

Four-fifths of 30 days is:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 30 = 24 \text{ days}
\]

So, by the end of 24 days, Mr. Johnson has 12 pills left. Since he started with a 30-day supply, it means that he initially had enough pills for 6 more days after these 24 days to reach a total of 30 days (30 - 24 = 6).

This shows that he must have used up the pills intended for the 24 days, minus the 12 pills he has left. Therefore, he used:
\[
30 \text{ days worth} - 6 \text{ more days worth} = 24 - 6 = 18 \text{ pills used in 24 days}
\]

Therefore, Mr. Johnson uses 18 pills over 24 days. So, the number of pills he takes per day is:
\[
18 \div 24 = 0.75 \text{ pills per day}
\]

The answer is that Mr. Johnson is supposed to take 0.75 pills per day.",0.75

- 6 buttermilk biscuits at $2.00 each: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) dollars

Now, add these amounts together to find the total cost:

\[ 30 + 18 + 12 = 60 \] dollars

Since the order total is over $50.00, the 10% discount applies. Calculate the discount:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.10 \times 60 = 6 \] dollars

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

"First, let's determine how many times Derek caught the ball. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Joe caught the ball 23 times, so double that is \(2 \times 23 = 46\). Derek made four less than that, so he caught the ball \(46 - 4 = 42\) times.

Next, we calculate how many times Tammy caught the ball. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. A third of Derek's catches is \(\frac{42}{3} = 14\). Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than that, so she caught the ball \(14 + 16 = 30\) times.

"First, determine the cost to feed each chicken. Since each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed, and a bag of feed weighing 20 pounds costs $2, the cost per pound of feed is $2 / 20 pounds = $0.10 per pound. Therefore, the cost to feed one chicken is 2 pounds x $0.10/pound = $0.20.

Next, calculate the profit per chicken. Since each chicken is sold for $1.50, and the cost to feed each chicken is $0.20, the profit per chicken is $1.50 - $0.20 = $1.30.

Now, use the total profit to find out how many chickens were sold. Lao made $65 in profit, and each chicken provides $1.30 in profit. Thus, the number of chickens sold is $65 / $1.30 = 50.

So, Lao sold 50 chickens.",50.0

"To determine how many ounces of white paint Marla adds, we first need to understand the proportions of the paints she is using. The paint consists of 70% blue, 20% red, and the remaining part is white. 

Given that blue paint makes up 70% of the total mixture, we can use the amount of blue paint to find the total amount of paint in the mixture.

1. **Calculate Total Paint:**

   If blue paint is 70% of the mixture, then the total amount of paint can be calculated by:

   \[
   \text{Total Paint} = \frac{\text{Blue Paint}}{0.7}
   \]

   Given that Marla adds 140 ounces of blue paint:

   \[
   \text{Total Paint} = \frac{140}{0.7} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Determine Amount of White Paint:**

   Since the mixture consists of 70% blue, 20% red, the remaining percentage is for the white paint:

   \[
   \text{Percentage of White Paint} = 100\% - 70\% - 20\% = 10\%
   \]

   The amount of white paint in the mixture is:

   \[
   \text{White Paint} = 10\% \times \text{Total Paint} = 0.1 \times 200 = 20 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Therefore, Marla adds 20 ounces of white paint.",20.0

"To determine how long it will take Rodney and Todd to reach the point where the river is 80 yards wide, we need to calculate the distance they will row and then use their rowing speed to find the time.

1. **Calculate the change in river width:**
   - The river starts at 50 yards wide and needs to reach 80 yards wide.
   - The increase in width is \(80 - 50 = 30\) yards.

2. **Convert the width change to meters:**
   - Since 1 yard is approximately 0.9144 meters, 30 yards is \(30 \times 0.9144 = 27.432\) meters.

3. **Determine the rate of increase in width:**
   - The river's width increases by 2 yards every 10 meters, which is equivalent to \(2 \times 0.9144 = 1.8288\) meters every 10 meters of river.
   - This is an increase of 1.8288 meters in width per 10 meters along the river.

4. **Calculate the distance rowed to achieve the width increase:**
   - If the river expands by 1.8288 meters over 10 meters, and we need an expansion of 27.432 meters:
   - The required rowing distance \(d\) is found by solving:
     \[
     \frac{d}{10} \times 1.8288 = 27.432
     \]
     \[
     d \times 0.18288 = 27.432

Since all but 4 guests eat brownies ala mode and each requires 2 scoops, we need to find out how many guests ate ala mode. Let's denote the total number of guests as \( G \).  

The number of guests who eat ala mode is \( G - 4 \).  

And since they all got 2 scoops, it means they needed:  
\( 2 \times (G - 4) \) scoops of ice cream.  

Since each tub provides 8 scoops, the number of tubs used is:  
\(\frac{2 \times (G - 4)}{8} = \frac{G - 4}{4}\)  

To find \( G \), note that each guest eating ala mode also ate at least 1 brownie piece. With 28 brownie pieces consumed, \( G - 4 \) guests can at most be 28, assuming each guest eats exactly one piece. Thus, the maximum \( G - 4 \) is 28, meaning \( G = 32 \).  

So, the number of guests who ate ala mode, \( G - 4 \), is 28.  

Calculate the scoops:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many gemstones Frankie has on his collar.

We know that Spaatz has 1 gemstone on her collar. According to the problem, Spaatz has two less than half as many gemstones as Frankie. Let’s set up an equation for that:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Frankie’s gemstones} - 2 = \text{Spaatz’s gemstones}
\]

Now, substituting the number of gemstones Spaatz has:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Frankie’s gemstones} - 2 = 1
\]

Add 2 to both sides to solve for half of Frankie’s gemstones:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Frankie’s gemstones} = 3
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to get the full number of Frankie’s gemstones:

\[
\text{Frankie’s gemstones} = 6
\]

Binkie has four times as many gemstones as Frankie, so:

\[
\text{Binkie’s gemstones} = 4 \times \text{Frankie's gemstones} = 4 \times 6 = 24
\]

Thus, Binkie has 24 gemstones on his collar.",24.0
"Edna made 150 cookies and intended for each of her 15 neighbors to take 10 cookies, which means all the cookies should have been taken if everyone took the correct amount (15 neighbors × 10 cookies each = 150 cookies).

However, there are only 8 cookies left, indicating that more than 142 cookies were taken (150 total cookies - 8 cookies left = 142 cookies intended to be taken).

Since 142 cookies were actually taken instead of the full 150, it means Sarah took the extra cookies above the correct amount of 10 per neighbor. 

Thus, Sarah took 8 extra cookies because there are 8 cookies left that should have been taken to complete the 150. Therefore, Sarah took 10 + 8 = 18 cookies in total.

The answer is: Sarah took 18 cookies.",18.0
"First, calculate the total number of boxes in the shipping container. There are 10 crates, and each crate contains 6 boxes:

\[ 10 \text{ crates} \times 6 \text{ boxes per crate} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, determine the number of washing machines initially in each box. Each box originally holds 4 washing machines. Therefore, the total initial number of washing machines is:

\[ 60 \text{ boxes} \times 4 \text{ washing machines per box} = 240 \text{ washing machines} \]

Since the worker removes 1 washing machine from each box, the total number of washing machines removed is equal to the number of boxes:

\[ 1 \text{ washing machine removed per box} \times 60 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ washing machines removed} \]

So, 60 washing machines were removed from the shipping container.",60.0

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Sand Dollars**: Simon collected a bag of ten sand dollars.

2. **Sea Glass**: The jar holds three times as many pieces of sea glass as there are sand dollars. Since there are 10 sand dollars, the jar holds 3 × 10 = 30 pieces of sea glass.

3. **Seashells**: The bucket holds five times as many seashells as there are pieces of sea glass. Since there are 30 pieces of sea glass, the bucket holds 5 × 30 = 150 seashells.

Finally, to find the total number of treasures Simon collected:

- Sand dollars: 10
- Sea glass: 30
- Seashells: 150

The total number of treasures is 10 + 30 + 150 = 190.

Thus, Simon found 190 treasures on the beach.",190.0
"Let's use the given information to solve the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of tent stakes be \( x \).

2. According to the problem, Rebecca bought 3 times as many packets of drink mix as tent stakes, so she bought \( 3x \) packets of drink mix.

3. She also bought 2 more bottles of water than she did tent stakes, so she bought \( x + 2 \) bottles of water.

4. In total, Rebecca bought 22 items. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 3x + (x + 2) = 22
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   5x + 2 = 22

"To solve this, we first need to determine the relationships between the lengths of the vehicles.

Let's denote:
- \( L_c \) as the length of the orange car,
- \( L_r \) as the length of the red bus,
- \( L_y \) as the length of the yellow bus.

Given:
1. The red bus is four times the length of the orange car:
   \[
   L_r = 4L_c
   \]

2. The orange car is 3.5 times shorter than the length of the yellow bus. This can be interpreted as:
   \[
   L_c = \frac{L_y}{3.5}
   \]
   or equivalently:
   \[
   L_y = 3.5L_c
   \]

3. The red bus is 48 feet long:
   \[
   L_r = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

Substitute \( L_r = 48 \) in the equation \( L_r = 4L_c \):
\[
48 = 4L_c
\]

Solve for \( L_c \):
\[
L_c = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ feet}
\]

Now use \( L_c \) to find \( L_y \):
\[
L_y = 3.5 \times 12 = 42 \text{ feet}

With the red bus and yellow bus next to each other, the yellow bus driver can see:
- The full length of the red bus, which is 48 feet.

Therefore, the yellow bus driver may see all 48 feet of the red bus. The answer is 48 feet.",48.0

"To calculate the average time Tony spends getting to the store, we need to find the time it takes for each trip and then average those times.

1. **Sunday (Walking):**
   - Speed: 2 MPH
   - Distance: 4 miles
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 2 MPH = 2 hours = 120 minutes

2. **Tuesday (Running):**
   - Speed: 10 MPH
   - Distance: 4 miles
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 10 MPH = 0.4 hours = 24 minutes

3. **Thursday (Running):**
   - Speed: 10 MPH
   - Distance: 4 miles
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 10 MPH = 0.4 hours = 24 minutes

Now, find the average time:
- Total time = 120 minutes (Sunday) + 24 minutes (Tuesday) + 24 minutes (Thursday) = 168 minutes

"To find Mario's original salary before the increase, we can set up the equation based on the given information:

Let \( x \) be Mario's original salary. According to the problem, Mario's salary increased by 40% to $4000. Therefore:

\[ x + 0.4x = 4000 \]

Combining terms, this can be simplified to:

\[ 1.4x = 4000 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{4000}{1.4} = 2857.14 \]

So, Mario's original salary was $2857.14.

Now, we know Bob's salary last year was three times Mario's salary this year, which is $4000:

\[ \text{Bob's salary last year} = 3 \times 4000 = 12000 \]

Bob's current salary is 20% more than his salary last year, so we calculate a 20% increase on his last year's salary:

\[ \text{Increase} = 0.2 \times 12000 = 2400 \]

So, Bob's current salary is:

\[ \text{Bob's current salary} = 12000 + 2400 = 14400 \]

The answer is $14,400.",14400.0

Jackie walks 3 more miles than Jessie in 6 days. The answer is 3 miles.",3.0
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. The 4th graders planted 30 trees.
2. The 5th graders planted twice as many trees as the 4th graders. This means the 5th graders planted 2 × 30 = 60 trees.
3. The 6th graders planted 30 fewer than thrice the number of trees planted by the 5th graders. First, calculate thrice the number of trees planted by the 5th graders: 3 × 60 = 180. Then subtract 30 from this value: 180 - 30 = 150 trees.

Now, let's add up the total number of trees planted by all the grades:

- 4th graders: 30 trees
- 5th graders: 60 trees

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of bread and treats both Wanda and Jane brought to the zoo.

First, we start with Wanda:

1. Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. 
2. According to the problem, Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Therefore, let the number of treats Wanda brings be \( t \). So, \( 3t = 90 \).
3. Solving for \( t \), we get \( t = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \).
4. So, Wanda brings 30 treats and 90 pieces of bread, totaling \( 30 + 90 = 120 \) pieces.

Next, we calculate for Jane:

1. Jane brings twice as many treats as Wanda because Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane. Therefore, Jane brings \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) treats.
2. Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats. Therefore, she brings \( 0.75 \times 60 = 45 \) pieces of bread.
3. So, Jane brings 60 treats and 45 pieces of bread, totaling \( 60 + 45 = 105 \) pieces.

Finally, to find out the total number of pieces of bread and treats brought by both Jane and Wanda, we add up both totals:

"First, let's determine the total number of students in the lunchroom. It is given that there are 2 monitors for every 15 students and there are 8 monitors:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ monitors}}{15 \text{ students}} = \frac{8 \text{ monitors}}{x \text{ students}} \]

Solving for \( x \), we have:

\[ x = \frac{8 \times 15}{2} = 60 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know that 40% of the students are girls:

\[ 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \text{ girls} \]

The remainder are boys:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ boys} \]

Next, we calculate the total cartons of milk consumed. Each boy drinks 1 carton of milk, and each girl drinks 2 cartons of milk.

Total cartons consumed by boys:

\[ 36 \text{ boys} \times 1 \text{ carton per boy} = 36 \text{ cartons} \]

Total cartons consumed by girls:

"To determine how many miles the old car can drive in 13 hours, we need to account for both the driving time and the cooling down periods.

1. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The car can drive \(8\) miles in \(1\) hour.
   - In \(5\) hours of driving, the car can travel \(5 \times 8 = 40\) miles.

2. **Cooling Period:**
   - After \(5\) hours of driving, the car must cool down for \(1\) hour.
   - This means the total period for each drive-and-cool cycle is \(5 + 1 = 6\) hours.

3. **Cycle Repetition:**
   - We see how many complete \(6\)-hour cycles fit into \(13\) hours:
     - \(13 \div 6 = 2\) full cycles, with a remainder of \(1\) hour.
   - So, the car goes through \(2\) full cycles and has \(1\) additional hour for driving.

4. **Total Distance:**
   - After \(2\) full \(6\)-hour cycles: 
     - \(2 \times 40 = 80\) miles.
   - In the \(1\) extra driving hour:
     - \(1 \times 8 = 8\) miles.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Total miles driven = \(80 + 8 = 88\) miles.

Thus, the old car can drive a total of \(88\) miles in \(13\) hours.",13.0

"To find the total number of loaves the baker bakes in 3 weeks, we first need to calculate how much he bakes each week.

**Weekday Baking (Monday to Friday):**
- The baker bakes for 5 hours each weekday.
- Each hour, in one oven, he bakes 5 loaves.
- He has 4 ovens.

So, loaves baked per weekday = 5 loaves/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 ovens = 100 loaves

Since there are 5 weekdays:
- Total weekday loaves per week = 100 loaves/day * 5 days = 500 loaves

**Weekend Baking (Saturday and Sunday):**
- The baker bakes for 2 hours each weekend day.
- Each hour, in one oven, he bakes 5 loaves.
- He has 4 ovens.

So, loaves baked per weekend day = 5 loaves/hour * 2 hours/day * 4 ovens = 40 loaves

"To find the final amount left in Bobby's paycheck, we need to deduct all the given taxes and fees from his initial salary of $450.

1. **Federal Taxes**:  
   Bobby pays 1/3 in federal taxes.  
   Federal tax = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150 \).

2. **State Taxes**:  
   Bobby pays 8% in state taxes.  
   State tax = \( 0.08 \times 450 = 36 \).

3. **Health Insurance**:  
   Deduction = $50.

4. **Life Insurance**:  
   Deduction = $20.

5. **City Parking Fee**:  
   Deduction = $10.

Now, calculate the total deductions:  
Total deductions = Federal tax + State tax + Health insurance + Life insurance + City parking fee  
Total deductions = 150 + 36 + 50 + 20 + 10 = 266.

"To make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream, Martha needs 4 cups of strawberries and 2 cups of heavy cream. Similarly, to make 1 quart of raspberry ice cream, she needs 4 cups of raspberries and 2 cups of heavy cream.

Let's calculate the cost for each type of ice cream:

**Strawberry Ice Cream:**
- Strawberries: She needs 4 cups of strawberries. Since the strawberries are sold in 2 cup packages for $3.00 each, she would need 2 packages. Thus, the cost for strawberries is 2 × $3.00 = $6.00.
- Heavy Cream: She needs 2 cups of heavy cream for the strawberry ice cream. Heavy cream is $4.00 for 4 cups, so 2 cups would cost $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Total cost for strawberry ice cream = $6.00 (strawberries) + $2.00 (cream) = $8.00.

**Raspberry Ice Cream:**
- Raspberries: She needs 4 cups of raspberries. Since the raspberries are sold in 2 cup packages for $5.00 each, she would need 2 packages. Thus, the cost for raspberries is 2 × $5.00 = $10.00.
- Heavy Cream: Similarly, she needs 2 cups of heavy cream for the raspberry ice cream. As calculated before, 2 cups cost $2.00.

Total cost for raspberry ice cream = $10.00 (raspberries) + $2.00 (cream) = $12.00.

Adding the costs of both types of ice cream together gives:
$8.00 (strawberry) + $12.00 (raspberry) = $20.00.

Therefore, it will cost Martha $20.00 to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.",1.0

   - Total for two flat tires: \(2 \times 500 = 1000\) cubic inches.

2. One tire is 40% full:
   - It currently has \(0.4 \times 500 = 200\) cubic inches.
   - It needs \(500 - 200 = 300\) cubic inches more.

3. One tire is 70% full:
   - It currently has \(0.7 \times 500 = 350\) cubic inches.
   - It needs \(500 - 350 = 150\) cubic inches more.

Now, calculate the total amount of air needed for all tires:
- Total air needed: \(1000 + 300 + 150 = 1450\) cubic inches.

Since each pump injects 50 cubic inches of air, calculate the number of pumps required:
- Number of pumps: \( \frac{1450}{50} = 29\).

Therefore, Carson will need 29 pumps to fill all the tires.",29.0

"To determine how many more blue tickets Tom Sawyer needs, we must first understand how many yellow tickets he is currently missing and convert the tickets he has into blue tickets.

1. **Current Yellow Tickets:** Tom already has 8 yellow tickets. To win a Bible, he needs 10 yellow tickets, so he is missing 2 yellow tickets.

2. **Convert Missing Yellow Tickets to Red Tickets:** Each yellow ticket requires 10 red tickets. Therefore, 2 yellow tickets require 2 × 10 = 20 red tickets.

3. **Current Red Tickets:** Tom already has 3 red tickets. He needs 20 red tickets in total to make the 2 yellow tickets. Therefore, he is missing 20 - 3 = 17 red tickets.

4. **Convert Missing Red Tickets to Blue Tickets:** Each red ticket requires 10 blue tickets. Therefore, 17 red tickets require 17 × 10 = 170 blue tickets.

5. **Current Blue Tickets:** Tom currently has 7 blue tickets. Thus, he needs 170 - 7 = 163 more blue tickets to make up for the missing 17 red tickets.

Therefore, Tom needs to earn 163 more blue tickets to win a new Bible.",163.0
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards to determine the number of fleas initially.

1. **Fourth treatment**: After the fourth treatment, the dog has 14 fleas left, which means before the fourth treatment it had twice that number: \(14 \times 2 = 28\) fleas.

2. **Third treatment**: Before the third treatment, the dog had twice the number of fleas it had after the third treatment: \(28 \times 2 = 56\) fleas.

3. **Second treatment**: Before the second treatment, the dog had: \(56 \times 2 = 112\) fleas.

4. **First treatment**: Before the first treatment, the dog had: \(112 \times 2 = 224\) fleas.

To find out how many more fleas the dog had before the treatments than after, we subtract the final number of fleas from the initial number:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Jason initially had.

1. Let \( x \) be the amount of money Jason initially had.

2. Jason spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his money on books, so he spends \( \frac{1}{4}x \) on books.

3. He also spends an additional $10 on books, so the total amount spent on books is \( \frac{1}{4}x + 10 \).

4. After spending on books, Jason has \( x - \left(\frac{1}{4}x + 10\right) = \frac{3}{4}x - 10 \) left.

5. Next, Jason spends \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the remaining money on DVDs. The remaining money before spending on DVDs is \( \frac{3}{4}x - 10 \), so he spends \( \frac{2}{5}(\frac{3}{4}x - 10) \) on DVDs.

6. He also spends an additional $8 on DVDs, so the total amount spent on DVDs is \( \frac{2}{5}(\frac{3}{4}x - 10) + 8 \).

7. After spending on DVDs, he is left with $130. Thus, we set up the equation:

   \[
   \left(\frac{3}{4}x - 10\right) - \left(\frac{2}{5}(\frac{3}{4}x - 10) + 8\right) = 130

   \[
   \frac{3}{4}x - 10 - \left(\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{3}{4}x - \frac{2}{5} \times 10 + 8\right) = 130

   \[
   \frac{3}{4}x - 10 - \left(\frac{3}{10}x - 4 + 8\right) = 130

   \[
   \frac{3}{4}x - 10 - \frac{3}{10}x + 4 - 8 = 130

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how quickly the cheetah closes the gap between itself and the gazelle when both are running at their respective top speeds.

First, let's find the relative speed between the cheetah and the gazelle in miles per hour.

1. The cheetah's speed is 60 mph.
2. The gazelle's speed is 40 mph.
3. The relative speed is 60 mph - 40 mph = 20 mph.

Next, we convert this relative speed from miles per hour to feet per second, using the given conversion rate of 1 mile per hour to 1.5 feet per second.

4. 20 mph * 1.5 feet per second/mph = 30 feet per second.

Now, we know the cheetah gains on the gazelle at a rate of 30 feet per second. The initial distance between them is 210 feet.

Finally, we calculate the time it will take for the cheetah to close this 210 feet gap:

"Let's define the variables to solve the problem:

- Let \( x \) be the number of apples Kylie picked.
  
According to the problem, Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the number of apples that Kylie picked. So, Kayla picked \( 4x + 10 \) apples.

Together, Kylie and Kayla picked 340 apples. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + (4x + 10) = 340 \]

Simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 4x + 10 = 340 \]

\[ 5x + 10 = 340 \]

2. His total salary for the week was $7,000.

3. Calculate Tobias’s earnings from selling green tractors:
   - Total earnings from green tractors: $7,000 (total salary) - $4,000 (earnings from red tractors) = $3,000.

4. Tobias earns 20% from each green tractor:
   - Let the price of a single green tractor be \( x \).
   - 3 green tractors earnings at 20% of the price of each: 3 * (20% of \( x \)) = $3,000.

5. Equation for the green tractors:
   - 3 * (0.20 * \( x \)) = $3,000.
   - 0.60 * \( x \) = $3,000.
   - Solve for \( x \): \( x = \frac{3,000}{0.60} = $5,000 \).

Therefore, the full price of a single green tractor is $5,000.",5000.0
"To solve the problem, we will work backward to find out how many suckers Jen originally had and how many she ate.

1. Callie received the last 5 suckers from Taylor. This means Taylor had 6 suckers before giving them away because Taylor ate 1 before giving the rest to Callie.

2. Harmony gave 6 suckers to Taylor. Harmony kept 3 suckers, which means Harmony had 9 suckers before giving the rest to Taylor.

3. Molly gave the suckers to Harmony after eating 2. So, Molly had 11 suckers before eating 2 (since she gave 9 to Harmony).

4. Jen gave half of her suckers to Molly. Therefore, Jen originally had 22 suckers, meaning she ate half of them, which is 11 suckers.

"First, let's determine how many men and women there were initially in the office.

Initially, there are 90 workers.
- 2/3rds of them are men: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 90 = 60 \) men.
- Therefore, the number of women is \( 90 - 60 = 30 \) women.

Now, the company hires 10 new employees, all women. Therefore, the number of women increases to \( 30 + 10 = 40 \) women.

The total number of workers in the office is now \( 90 + 10 = 100 \).

To find the percentage of women in the company: 
\[ \text{Percentage of women} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of women}}{\text{Total number of workers}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of women} = \left( \frac{40}{100} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

"To find out how much Tilly bought each bag for, we need to consider her total income from selling the bags and her desired profit.

1. **Total Income from Sales**: Tilly sells 100 bags at $10 each, so her total income is:
   \[
   100 \times 10 = \$1,000 
   \]

2. **Profit**: Tilly wants a profit of $300. Profit is calculated as:
   \[

"First, we determine how many fish Alex initially caught. Since Alex caught 7 times as many fish as Jacob, and Jacob had 8 fish, Alex caught:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ fish}. \]

Then, we account for the fish Alex lost. He lost 23 fish, so he now has:

\[ 56 - 23 = 33 \text{ fish}. \]

Jacob currently has 8 fish, and he wants to have one more fish than Alex's current total of 33 fish. To achieve that, he needs:

\[ 33 + 1 = 34 \text{ fish}. \]

Therefore, Jacob needs to catch:

\[ 34 - 8 = 26 \text{ more fish}. \]

The answer is that Jacob needs to catch 26 more fish to beat Alex by 1 fish.",1.0

"John plays for 2 periods, and each period is 12 minutes, so the total playing time is 2 x 12 = 24 minutes.

Every 4 minutes, John scores:
- 2 shots worth 2 points each, totaling 2 x 2 = 4 points
- 1 shot worth 3 points, totaling 3 points

So, every 4 minutes, John scores 4 + 3 = 7 points.

Since John plays for 24 minutes, we divide the total time by the 4-minute intervals: 24 ÷ 4 = 6 intervals.

Therefore, John scores 7 points per 4-minute interval for 6 intervals, which is 7 x 6 = 42 points.

The answer is 42 points.",42.0
"First, let's calculate how much Loisa will pay under the installment plan:

1. Down payment: $100

2. First 4 months: 4 × $40 = $160

3. Next 4 months: 4 × $35 = $140

4. Last 4 months: 4 × $30 = $120

Adding these amounts together, the total cost when bought on the installment plan is:

1. **Calculate how many sausages Mr. Castiel ate on Monday:**

   - He ate 2/5 of the 600 sausages on Monday.
   - Calculation: \((2/5) \times 600 = 240\).
   - So, he ate 240 sausages on Monday.

2. **Calculate how many sausages are left after Monday:**

   - Initially, there were 600 sausages. After eating 240, the remaining are:
   - Calculation: \(600 - 240 = 360\).

3. **Calculate how many sausages he ate on Tuesday:**

   - On Tuesday, he ate half of the remaining sausages.
   - Remaining from Monday: 360.
   - Calculation: \((1/2) \times 360 = 180\).
   - So, he ate 180 sausages on Tuesday.

4. **Calculate how many sausages are left for Friday:**

   - After Tuesday, the remaining sausages are:
   - Calculation: \(360 - 180 = 180\).

5. **Calculate how many sausages he ate on Friday:**

   - On Friday, he ate 3/4 of the remaining sausages.

"First, let's calculate the number of hours Jessica's family spends traveling when they do not stop. If they're traveling at 50 km/h, you divide the total distance by their speed:

\[ \text{Travel time without stops} = \frac{300 \text{ km}}{50 \text{ km/h}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate how many 2-hour segments are within these 6 hours, because they stop for 30 minutes every 2 hours:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/segment}} = 3 \text{ segments} \]

Since they rest for 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours) every 2 hours, they will take:

\[ 3 \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how much it costs to increase the weight of the vest, we first need to determine the additional weight Thomas wants to add:

1. **Calculate the additional weight needed:**

   The original weight of the vest is 60 pounds. Thomas wants to increase it by 60%, so:
   \[
   \text{Additional weight} = 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \text{ pounds}

2. **Determine the number of ingots needed:**

   Since each ingot weighs 2 pounds, the number of ingots Thomas needs is:
   \[
   \text{Number of ingots} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ ingots}

4. **Apply a discount if applicable:**

   Since Thomas is buying more than 10 ingots, he qualifies for a 20% discount. Calculate the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.20 \times 90 = \$18

"First, calculate the total number of seats being added:

5 rows * 8 seats per row = 40 seats.

Next, calculate the total cost without any discounts:

40 seats * $30 per seat = $1,200.

Now, determine how many groups of 10 seats are in the 40 seats:

40 seats ÷ 10 seats per group = 4 groups of 10.

Each group of 10 seats receives a 10% discount:

Cost for each group of 10 seats before discount = 10 seats * $30 = $300.
Discount on each group = 10% of $300 = $30.

Total discount for 4 groups = 4 * $30 = $120.

Finally, subtract the total discount from the initial total cost:

$1,200 - $120 = $1,080.

The school will pay $1,080 for the new seats.",1080.0

"First, let's calculate the total number of calves born:

- 9 llamas got pregnant with 1 calf each, so that’s 9 calves.
- 5 llamas got pregnant with twins, so that’s 5 x 2 = 10 calves.

In total, Jill has 9 + 10 = 19 calves.

Now, Jill traded 8 of the calves for 2 new adult llamas. This leaves her with:

19 - 8 = 11 calves.

Now, let's determine the total number of adult llamas Jill has. She started with 9 + 5 = 14 adult llamas. With the trade, she receives 2 more adult llamas:

14 + 2 = 16 adult llamas.

Therefore, Jill has 11 calves and 16 adult llamas, which totals:

11 + 16 = 27 llamas.

Finally, Jill sells 1/3 of her herd at the market. The herd includes both calves and adult llamas. Calculating one third:

1/3 of 27 is 27 / 3 = 9 llamas sold.

After the sale, Jill has 27 - 9 = 18 llamas remaining.

Thus, Jill now has 18 llamas in total.",18.0
"To find the total number of minnows, we start with the information about the red-bellied minnows. Since 40% of the minnows have red bellies and this number is given as 20 minnows, we can set up the equation:

40% of total minnows = 20
0.40 * total minnows = 20

To find the total number of minnows, we divide both sides by 0.40:

total minnows = 20 / 0.40
total minnows = 50

Now that we know there are 50 minnows in total, we can determine the number of minnows with white bellies. We already know that 40% have red bellies and 30% have green bellies, totaling 70% of the minnows. This means:

100% - 70% = 30% of the minnows have white bellies.

So, 30% of the total number of minnows is:

0.30 * 50 = 15

Therefore, there are 15 minnows with white bellies.",15.0

2. Each motorcycle has 2 wheels.
3. There are 19 cars in the parking lot.
4. Altogether, all vehicles have 117 wheels.

First, calculate the total number of wheels contributed by the cars:

- Each car has 5 wheels.
- There are 19 cars.

So, the total number of wheels from the cars is:  
\[ 19 \text{ cars} \times 5 \text{ wheels/car} = 95 \text{ wheels.} \]

Next, we'll let \( x \) be the number of motorcycles in the parking lot. Since each motorcycle has 2 wheels, the total number of wheels from motorcycles is:

"To determine how many more toothbrushes Dr. Banks gave out in the busiest month versus the slowest month, we need to calculate the number of toothbrushes he gave away each month.

1. **January**: 53 toothbrushes
2. **February**: 67 toothbrushes
3. **March**: 46 toothbrushes

First, we need to find out how many toothbrushes were left for April and May:

Total toothbrushes = 330

Toothbrushes given away by the end of March = 53 (January) + 67 (February) + 46 (March) = 166

Toothbrushes remaining = 330 - 166 = 164

These remaining 164 toothbrushes were given away equally in April and May, so:

"To solve this problem, start by determining the individual quantities of white and black scores based on the ratio 7:6.

The ratio 7:6 indicates that for every 7 white scores, there are 6 black scores. The total parts of the ratio are 7 + 6 = 13 parts.

Since Taylor got 78 yellow scores in total:
Each part of the ratio is \(\frac{78}{13} = 6\).

The number of white scores = 7 parts, which is \(7 \times 6 = 42\).

The number of black scores = 6 parts, which is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, calculate the difference between the number of black and white scores:
Difference = 42 (white scores) - 36 (black scores) = 6.

"To find out how many followers Denny will have after one year, we need to account for both his gain in followers and those who unfollowed him.

1. Denny gains 1,000 new followers every day.
2. The number of days in a year is typically 365.

So, in a year, Denny gains:

1,000 followers/day × 365 days = 365,000 new followers.

Starting with 100,000 followers and then adding the new followers gained in a year:

100,000 + 365,000 = 465,000 followers.

However, 20,000 people unfollowed him during this time. 

So, we subtract the unfollowers from the total:

465,000 - 20,000 = 445,000 followers.

Therefore, Denny will have 445,000 followers after a year.",445000.0
"In a triangle, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. We are given that angle A is 60 degrees, and angle B is two times as big as angle C. Let's denote angle C as \( x \). Therefore, angle B will be \( 2x \).

Using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up the equation:

\[ 60 + 2x + x = 180 \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 60 + 3x = 180 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 3x = 120 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, angle C is 40 degrees. Since angle B is two times angle C:

\[ B = 2x = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

The angle of B is 80 degrees.",80.0

Adding the amounts together, Lilia earned $20 + $5 = $25 after selling 14 peaches. The answer is $25.",25.0
"To solve this problem, we will first determine how much money each machine provides and then use that information to find out how many machines there are.

Each machine contains:
- 80 quarters
- 100 dimes

To find the total value of the quarters in one machine:
80 quarters × $0.25 per quarter = $20

To find the total value of the dimes in one machine:
100 dimes × $0.10 per dime = $10

Adding these amounts gives the total cash in one machine:
$20 (quarters) + $10 (dimes) = $30

The problem states that Erin has a total of $90 after emptying all the machines. To find out how many machines there are, we divide the total amount of money by the amount per machine:

$90 ÷ $30 per machine = 3 machines

"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of fish in the aquarium over time accounting for the Bobbit worm's consumption and the addition of new fish. 

1. The Bobbit worm eats 2 fish per day.
2. Two weeks (14 days) pass before James adds more fish. In those 14 days, the worm eats:
   \[
   2 \text{ fish/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ fish}

"To determine how much Nancy's ex owes her in child support over the seven-year period, we need to calculate the total child support amount for each year based on his income and then subtract what he has already paid.

1. **First 3 years:**
   - Annual income = $30,000
   - Child support per year = 30% of $30,000 = 0.30 * $30,000 = $9,000
   - For 3 years: 3 * $9,000 = $27,000

2. **Next 4 years:**
   - He got a 20% raise, so new income = $30,000 + (0.20 * $30,000) = $36,000

"To find the average number of hits each player, excluding the best player, will have over the next 6 games, we first need to determine how many hits the other players have averaged so far.

The team averaged 15 hits per game over the first 5 games, which totals:
\[ 15 \text{ hits/game} \times 5 \text{ games} = 75 \text{ hits} \]

The best player had 25 of these hits, so the other 10 players combined have:
\[ 75 \text{ total hits} - 25 \text{ best player's hits} = 50 \text{ hits} \]

Therefore, the other 10 players averaged 50 hits over the first 5 games, which means:

Now, if the other 10 players continue their average of 10 hits per game over the next 6 games, they will have:
\[ 10 \text{ hits/game} \times 6 \text{ games} = 60 \text{ total hits over 6 games for the team (excluding the best player)} \]

Since there are 10 players contributing to these 60 hits over 6 games, each will average:

The total cost of transporting these 4000 kgs is $6000.

Next, let's determine the total weight of three times as many bags, with each bag weighing 3/5 times as many kgs. Three times as many bags means:

\(80 \text{ bags} \times 3 = 240 \text{ bags}\).

Each of these bags weighs 3/5 as much as a 50 kg bag, so:

\(50 \text{ kgs/bag} \times \frac{3}{5} = 30 \text{ kgs/bag}\).

Therefore, the total weight of 240 bags, each 30 kgs, is:

\(240 \text{ bags} \times 30 \text{ kgs/bag} = 7200 \text{ kgs}\).

Since we know the cost of transporting 4000 kgs is $6000, the cost per kilogram is:

"To determine how many bags of corn seeds each kid used, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of seeds needed for each row:**
   - Each row of corn contains 70 ears.
   - You need 2 seeds per ear of corn.
   - Therefore, each row requires \( 70 \times 2 = 140 \) seeds.

2. **Determine the number of bags of seeds needed for each row:**
   - Each bag of corn seeds contains 48 seeds.
   - To find out how many bags are needed for one row, you divide the total seeds needed by the number of seeds per bag:
     \( \frac{140}{48} \approx 2.92 \).
   - Since you can't use a fraction of a bag, you'll need 3 bags per row to have enough seeds.

3. **Calculate the number of rows each kid planted:**
   - The kids earn $1.5 per row.
   - Each kid spends half of their earnings on a dinner costing $36.
   - Therefore, each kid earned \( 36 \times 2 = 72 \) dollars (since they spent half on dinner).
   - To find out how many rows each kid planted, divide their total earnings by the amount paid per row:
     \( \frac{72}{1.5} = 48 \) rows.

4. **Determine the total number of bags used by each kid:**

The supermarket is 10 miles farther from her school, making it a round trip of:

\(20 miles (school round trip) + 10 miles (to the supermarket) = 30 miles for one supermarket round trip.\)

Laura drives to the supermarket two afternoons a week. Therefore, her additional driving to the supermarket is:

30 miles/round trip × 2 days = 60 miles per week.

Adding the miles to and from school and the trips to the supermarket gives:

100 miles (school commutes) + 60 miles (supermarket) = 160 miles per week.

Therefore, Laura drives 160 miles per week.",160.0

"Carter currently has 9 plants, and he wants to have a total of 12 plants. This means he needs 12 - 9 = 3 more plants.

Carter used 3 seed packets to grow 9 plants, which means each seed packet yields 9 / 3 = 3 plants.

To find out how many additional seed packets he needs to grow 3 more plants, we divide the number of additional plants needed (3) by the number of plants each seed packet yields (3):

3 plants needed / 3 plants per seed packet = 1 seed packet.

Therefore, Carter needs 1 more seed packet to have a total of 12 plants in his backyard.",12.0

"First, let's calculate the weekly rental fee. Since the camera is valued at $5000 and the rental fee is 10% of the camera's value per week, the weekly rental fee is:

10% of $5000 = 0.10 × 5000 = $500 per week.

John rented the camera for 4 weeks, so the total rental fee is:

$500/week × 4 weeks = $2000.

John's friend agreed to pay 40% of the rental fee. So, the amount that John's friend will pay is:

40% of $2000 = 0.40 × 2000 = $800.

Therefore, the amount that John needs to pay is the total rental fee minus what his friend pays:

$2000 - $800 = $1200.

John paid $1200.",1200.0
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the combined rate at which the pugs clean their house. If four pugs can clean the house in 45 minutes, we can find their combined rate of work:

1. **Find the rate for 4 pugs:**
   - If 4 pugs take 45 minutes to clean the house, their combined rate is 1 house per 45 minutes.
   - Therefore, \( \text{Rate of 4 pugs} = \frac{1}{45} \) house per minute.

2. **Find the rate for 1 pug:**
   - Since 4 pugs have a rate of \( \frac{1}{45} \) house per minute, the rate for 1 pug is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{45} = \frac{1}{180} \) house per minute.

3. **Find the rate for 15 pugs:**
   - Now, we multiply the rate of 1 pug by 15 to get the rate for 15 pugs:
   - \( \text{Rate of 15 pugs} = 15 \times \frac{1}{180} = \frac{15}{180} = \frac{1}{12} \) house per minute.

4. **Find the time it takes 15 pugs to clean the house:**
   - Since 15 pugs can clean \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per minute, it will take them:
   - \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{12}} = 12 \) minutes to clean the house.

Therefore, 15 pugs working together will be able to clean their house in 12 minutes.",12.0
"To determine how many jalapeno peppers are required, we start by calculating the number of sandwiches served in an 8-hour day.

1. **Calculate the number of minutes in 8 hours:**
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine how many sandwiches are served in 480 minutes:**
   \[
   \frac{480 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ minutes/sandwich}} = 96 \text{ sandwiches}

3. **Calculate the number of jalapeno strips needed for 96 sandwiches:**
   Each sandwich requires 4 strips of jalapeno pepper, so:
   \[
   96 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ strips/sandwich} = 384 \text{ strips}
   \]

4. **Determine how many jalapeno peppers are needed for 384 strips:**
   One jalapeno pepper makes 8 slices, so:
   \[
   \frac{384 \text{ strips}}{8 \text{ strips/pepper}} = 48 \text{ jalapeno peppers}

"To determine how tall the tree will be in 4 months, we first need to convert 4 months into weeks since the growth rate is given in weeks. 

1. Convert months to weeks:
   - Assuming an average month is about 4.33 weeks, 4 months is approximately \(4 \times 4.33 = 17.32\) weeks. For simplicity, we will use 17 weeks.

2. Calculate the growth over 17 weeks:
   - The tree grows 50 centimeters every 2 weeks. 
   - Over 17 weeks, the number of 2-week periods is \( \frac{17}{2} \approx 8.5 \). Since we can’t have half a growth period, we’ll consider it as 8 full periods.
   - For 8 periods, the tree will grow \(8 \times 50 = 400\) centimeters.

3. Calculate the total height of the tree in 4 months:
   - The current height of the tree is 2 meters, which is 200 centimeters (since 1 meter = 100 centimeters).

"First, let's calculate the total number of horses that the blacksmith needs to make horseshoes for the farms and stables.

There are 2 farms, each with 2 horses, contributing:  
\[ 2 \, \text{farms} \times 2 \, \text{horses/farm} = 4 \, \text{horses} \]

There are 2 stables, each with 5 horses, contributing:  
\[ 2 \, \text{stables} \times 5 \, \text{horses/stable} = 10 \, \text{horses} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of horses at the farms and stables:  
\[ 4 \, \text{horses} + 10 \, \text{horses} = 14 \, \text{horses} \]

Each horse needs 4 horseshoes, and each horseshoe requires 2 kg of iron. Thus, each horse requires:  
\[ 4 \, \text{horseshoes/horse} \times 2 \, \text{kg/horseshoe} = 8 \, \text{kg of iron/horse} \]

So, for 14 horses, the total iron required is:  
\[ 14 \, \text{horses} \times 8 \, \text{kg/horse} = 112 \, \text{kg of iron} \]

The blacksmith starts with 400 kg of iron. After fulfilling orders for the farms and stables, the remaining iron is:  
\[ 400 \, \text{kg} - 112 \, \text{kg} = 288 \, \text{kg} \]

Now, calculate how many horseshoes can be made with the remaining 288 kg of iron. Each horseshoe requires 2 kg of iron, so:  
\[ \frac{288 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/horseshoe}} = 144 \, \text{horseshoes} \]

Since each horse requires 4 horseshoes, the number of horses that can get new horseshoes at the riding school is:  
\[ \frac{144 \, \text{horseshoes}}{4 \, \text{horseshoes/horse}} = 36 \, \text{horses} \]

Therefore, 36 horses at the riding school can get new horseshoes.",36.0
"Let's set up the situation with equations. Let \( x \) be the number of years it will take for Joel's dad to be twice as old as Joel.

- Joel's current age is 5, so in \( x \) years, Joel will be \( 5 + x \) years old.
- Joel's dad's current age is 32, so in \( x \) years, Joel's dad will be \( 32 + x \) years old.

We want to find the value of \( x \) when Joel's dad's age is twice that of Joel's:

\[
32 + x = 2(5 + x)
\]

Expanding this equation:

\[
32 + x = 10 + 2x
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
32 + x = 10 + 2x
\]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:

\[
32 = 10 + x
\]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
22 = x
\]

So, it will take 22 years for Joel's dad to be twice as old as Joel. By that time, Joel will be:

\( 5 + 22 = 27 \) years old.

Therefore, Joel will be 27 years old when his dad is twice as old as him.",27.0

"First, let's calculate the taxes, which are 10% of the total revenue:

Taxes = 10% of $400,000 = 0.10 × $400,000 = $40,000.

Subtract the taxes from the revenue to find the remaining amount:

Remaining amount after taxes = $400,000 - $40,000 = $360,000.

Next, calculate the expenses for marketing and ads, which are 5% of the remaining amount:

Marketing and ads = 5% of $360,000 = 0.05 × $360,000 = $18,000.

Subtract the marketing and ads expenses from the remaining amount:

Remaining amount after marketing and ads = $360,000 - $18,000 = $342,000.

Now, calculate the operational costs, which are 20% of the remaining amount:

Operational costs = 20% of $342,000 = 0.20 × $342,000 = $68,400.

Subtract the operational costs from the remaining amount:

Remaining amount after operational costs = $342,000 - $68,400 = $273,600.

Finally, calculate the amount reserved for employee wages, which is 15% of the remaining amount:

Employee wages = 15% of $273,600 = 0.15 × $273,600 = $41,040.

Since there are 10 employees, each employee receives:

Amount per employee = $41,040 ÷ 10 = $4,104.

Therefore, each employee is paid $4,104 monthly.",4104.0

"To make 9 quarts of syrup, Jerry needs 500 cherries per quart, which amounts to:

\[ 9 \text{ quarts} \times 500 \text{ cherries/quart} = 4500 \text{ cherries} \]

Now, we calculate the time it will take for Jerry to pick 4500 cherries. He picks 300 cherries in 2 hours, so his picking rate is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cherries}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 150 \text{ cherries/hour} \]

To find out how many hours it takes to pick 4500 cherries, we use his picking rate:

\[ \frac{4500 \text{ cherries}}{150 \text{ cherries/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the time to make the syrup. Jerry takes 3 hours to make each batch of syrup. Since he needs 9 quarts, and each quart requires the same amount of processing time, he needs:

\[ 9 \text{ quarts} \times 3 \text{ hours/quart} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time required for picking and making syrup, we get:

On Thursday, the sales from Wednesday were tripled, which means he sold 3 * 21 = 63 books on Thursday.

To find the total number of books Matias sold during these three days, we add up the books sold each day:
7 (Tuesday) + 21 (Wednesday) + 63 (Thursday) = 91 books.

Therefore, Matias sold a total of 91 books over the three days.",91.0
"Reggie started with no marbles, and his friend started with 100 marbles. Each game, they bet 10 marbles. After 9 games, Reggie has 90 marbles.

To find out how many games Reggie won and lost, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( x \) be the number of games Reggie won, and \( y \) be the number of games Reggie lost.

We know:

1. \( x + y = 9 \) because they played 9 games in total.
2. Each game results in a transfer of 10 marbles, so:
   - For each game Reggie wins, he gains 10 marbles.
   - For each game Reggie loses, he loses 10 marbles.

Since Reggie ends up with 90 marbles:

\[
10x - 10y = 90
\]

Now, we have the system of equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 9 \\
10x - 10y &= 90 \\
\end{align*}
\]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 10:

\[
x - y = 9
\]

Now, we solve the system:

1. \( x + y = 9 \)
2. \( x - y = 9 \)

Adding the two equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
(x + y) + (x - y) &= 9 + 9 \\
2x &= 18 \\
x &= 9
\end{align*}
\]

Substituting \( x = 9 \) back into \( x + y = 9 \):

\[
\begin{align*}
9 + y &= 9 \\
y &= 0
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, Reggie won all 9 games and lost 0. Therefore, he lost 0 games.",0.0

For a field with a side length of 5000 feet, the perimeter would be:

\[ P = 4 \times 5000 = 20000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, Melany needs to buy wire mesh to fence this perimeter. Each foot of wire mesh costs $30, so the total cost to fence 20000 feet is:

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Bella has 10 earrings, which is 25% of Monica's earrings. This means Monica has 4 times as many earrings as Bella because 25% is one quarter. Therefore, Monica has:
   \[
   10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ earrings}
   \]

2. Monica has twice as many earrings as Rachel. So, if Rachel has \( x \) earrings, then:
   \[
   2x = 40
   \]
   Solving for \( x \), we find:
   \[
   x = 20 \text{ earrings}
   \]

3. Now we can find the total number of earrings Bella, Monica, and Rachel have together:
   \[
   10 + 40 + 20 = 70 \text{ earrings}

Thus, Bella, Monica, and Rachel have a total of 70 earrings. The answer is 70.",70.0
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the original population of the town before the new people moved in.

1. Let \( P \) represent the original population of the town.

2. After 100 new people move in, the population becomes \( P + 100 \).

3. Then, 400 people move out, resulting in a population of:
   \[
   (P + 100) - 400 = P - 300
   \]

4. Every year afterward, the population is halved. After 4 years, the population is 60 people. 

   Let's work backward to find the population before it was halved each year.

   - After 4 years: \( 60 \) people
   - After 3 years (before halving for the 4th year): \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) people
   - After 2 years (before halving for the 3rd year): \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \) people
   - After 1 year (before halving for the 2nd year): \( 240 \times 2 = 480 \) people
   - Initial (after changes and before halving for the 1st year): \( 480 \times 2 = 960 \) people

Thus, the initial population after the new people moved in and 400 moved out was 960. Therefore, solve for \( P \):
\[
P - 300 = 960
\]
\[
P = 960 + 300 = 1260
\]

So, the original population of the town before the new people moved in was 1260 people.",1260.0
"Let’s break down Joe’s spending and selling pattern monthly:

\[ 22 \times 5 = 110 \text{ markers} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of markers the students in the first and second groups will use:

- The first group has 10 students, each with 2 markers, so they will use:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ markers} \]

- The second group has 15 students, each with 4 markers, so they will use:

\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ markers} \]

Adding the markers used by both groups, we get:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Grant made each month and then add those amounts together.

1. **First Month:**
   - Grant made $350.

2. **Second Month:**
   - He made $50 more than double what he made the first month.
   - Double the first month's earnings is \(2 \times 350 = 700\).
   - So, the amount in the second month is \(700 + 50 = 750\).

3. **Third Month:**
   - He quadrupled the sum of the first two months.

   - Assuming he starts with wall push-ups on Day 1, he reaches 15 reps on Day 15.
   - Once he reaches 15 reps, he transitions to high elevation push-ups. For simplicity, we'll assume he restarts his count and follows the same method (adding 1 rep per day).

3. **Low Elevation Push-ups:**
   - Similarly, he reaches 15 high elevation push-ups on Day 15 from when he started high elevation push-ups.

4. **Floor Push-ups:**
   - He transitions to floor push-ups after reaching 15 low elevation push-ups on Day 15 from when he started low elevation push-ups.

Since he trains 5 days a week, let's calculate the number of weeks it takes:

- Each stage (wall, high elevation, low elevation) consists of 15 days of progress.
- Total days for each stage = 15 days.
- Total stages before floor push-ups = 3 stages (wall, high elevation, low elevation).

So, his total training days before floor push-ups are 15 days/stage × 3 stages = 45 days.

Since he trains 5 days per week:
- Total weeks = 45 days ÷ 5 days/week = 9 weeks.

John will take 9 weeks to progress to floor push-ups.",9.0

"Let's figure out how many skips each throw made, working backwards from the fifth throw:

1. The fifth throw skips 8 times.
2. The fourth throw skips one fewer time than the fifth throw, so it skips 8 - 1 = 7 times.
3. The third throw skips 3 more times than the fourth throw, so it skips 7 + 3 = 10 times.
4. The second throw skips twice as many times as the third throw, which means it skips 10 / 2 = 5 times.
5. The first throw skips two fewer times than the second throw, so it skips 5 - 2 = 3 times.

Now, we find the total number of skips:  
3 (first throw) + 5 (second throw) + 10 (third throw) + 7 (fourth throw) + 8 (fifth throw) = 33 skips.

So, he made a total of 33 skips across the water with all of his throws.",33.0

"To find the percent of the town that is immune in some way, we need to consider all the people who are either vaccinated, have recovered, or both. 

Let's break it down: 

1. 1/3 of the townspeople have received the full vaccine.
2. 1/3 of the townspeople are immune because they have already recovered.
3. 1/6 of the townspeople are counted in both groups (those who are vaccinated and have recovered).

To determine the total fraction of people who are immune, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion:

- First, add the vaccinated and recovered fractions: \( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \).
- Next, subtract the overlap (those who are counted twice in the above total): \( \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{6} \).

To perform the subtraction, it's useful to convert the fractions to a common denominator. The least common denominator of 3 and 6 is 6:

- Convert \(\frac{2}{3}\) to \(\frac{4}{6}\).

Now subtract:

The tree is initially covered by 40 feet of ivy. To find out how many days it will take Cary to remove all the ivy, we divide the total amount of ivy by the net amount removed per day:

40 feet ÷ 4 feet/day = 10 days

Therefore, it will take Cary 10 days to strip all the ivy off the tree.",10.0
"Initially, James eats a quarter pound of asparagus and a quarter pound of broccoli per day. That amounts to 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 pounds of vegetables per day.

In a week (7 days), he eats 0.5 pounds/day * 7 days = 3.5 pounds of vegetables.

After 2 weeks, he doubles that amount, so he eats 3.5 pounds * 2 = 7 pounds of vegetables per week from asparagus and broccoli.

He also adds 3 pounds of kale per week.

Thus, the total number of pounds of vegetables he eats per week after adding kale is 7 + 3 = 10 pounds.",10.0
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Louise is hanging a total of 30 pictures.

2. She hangs some of them vertically.

3. She hangs half of them horizontally.

4. She hangs the remaining 5 pictures haphazardly.

To find out how many pictures Louise hangs vertically, let's denote the number of vertically hung pictures as \( x \).

From the information, we can set up the following equation:

- Horizontally hung pictures: \(\frac{30}{2} = 15\)

- Haphazardly hung pictures: 5

Since the total number of pictures is 30, we have:

\[ x + 15 + 5 = 30 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 20 = 30 \]

\[ x = 30 - 20 \]

"Let's first calculate the total number of hours the employee worked during the week.

1. **First 3 days of the workweek:**  
   The employee works 6 hours per day.  
   Total hours for the first 3 days = 3 days × 6 hours/day = 18 hours.

2. **Remaining 2 days of the workweek:**  
   The employee works twice as many hours per day as in the first 3 days. So, he works 6 hours × 2 = 12 hours per day.  
   Total hours for the remaining 2 days = 2 days × 12 hours/day = 24 hours.

Adding these gives the total hours worked:  
18 hours + 24 hours = 42 hours.

The employee makes $30 per hour for the first 40 hours and an additional 50% for every hour above 40, which means $30 + $15 = $45 per hour for overtime.

"To find the total number of students in both the Elementary School and Middle School, we need to calculate the number of students in the Elementary School and then add it to the number of students in the Middle School.

The number of students in the Middle School is given as 50.

For the Elementary School, the problem states that there are three less than four times the number of students in the Middle School. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of students in Elementary School} = 4 \times (\text{Number of students in Middle School}) - 3 \]

Substituting the number of students in the Middle School:

1. Determine how many times Brian goes fishing:
   - Chris goes fishing 10 times.
   - Brian goes fishing twice as often, so Brian goes 2 * 10 = 20 times.

2. Determine how many fish Chris catches per trip:
   - Let X be the number of fish Chris catches per trip.
   - Brian catches 2/5 times fewer fish than Chris per trip. This means Brian catches (3/5)X fish per trip (since 1 - 2/5 = 3/5).

3. Determine how many fish Brian catches in total:
   - We know Brian catches 400 fish every time he goes fishing.
   - Therefore, (3/5)X = 400.
   - Solving for X, we have: X = 400 * (5/3) = 666.67 (approximately). Since the number of fish must be a whole number, this should indicate rounding differences or misalignment in typical problem settings. Let's assume Chris catches approximately 667 fish per trip.

4. Determine how many fish Chris catches in total:
   - Chris catches approximately 667 fish per trip.
   - He went fishing 10 times, so he caught approximately 667 * 10 = 6670 fish.

5. Total the fish caught by both:
   - Brian: 400 fish/trip * 20 trips = 8000 fish.

"First, we need to calculate the total area of Wendi's grassland property in square feet:

200 feet × 900 feet = 180,000 square feet.

Next, we convert the area from square feet to square yards, since each rabbit clears 10 square yards per day. There are 9 square feet in a square yard, so:

180,000 square feet ÷ 9 square feet per square yard = 20,000 square yards.

Now we calculate how many square yards the 100 rabbits can clear in a day. Each rabbit clears 10 square yards per day:

100 rabbits × 10 square yards per rabbit per day = 1,000 square yards per day.

Finally, we determine how many days it will take for the rabbits to clear all 20,000 square yards:

20,000 square yards ÷ 1,000 square yards per day = 20 days.

So, it would take Wendi's 100 rabbits 20 days to clear all the grass off of her property.",20.0
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $20.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 + $15.00 + $20.00 + $20.00 + $15.00 = $115.00

Next, we'll apply the 20% new-customer discount to this total:

Discount = 20% of $115.00 = 0.20 x $115.00 = $23.00

Finally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Julia will spend:

Total cost after discount = $115.00 - $23.00 = $92.00

Julia will spend $92.00 on the new puppy.",92.0
"To find the total number of fish all four people have, we can calculate the number of fish each person has and then sum them up:

1. **Billy:** He has 10 fish.

2. **Tony:** He has 3 times as many fish as Billy. Since Billy has 10 fish, Tony has 3 × 10 = 30 fish.

3. **Sarah:** She has 5 more fish than Tony. Since Tony has 30 fish, Sarah has 30 + 5 = 35 fish.

4. **Bobby:** He has twice as many fish as Sarah. Since Sarah has 35 fish, Bobby has 2 × 35 = 70 fish.

Now, add them all together:
- Billy has 10 fish.

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2b + 22 = 34 \]

Subtract 22 from both sides:

\[ 2b = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ b = 6 \]

So, there are 6 boys signed up. Since there are 22 more girls than boys:

Each boy got 1 more egg than each girl, meaning each boy got 2 eggs. Let \( b \) represent the number of boys. Thus, the number of eggs given to the boys is:

\[ 2b = 20 \]

Solving for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[ b = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Therefore, there were 10 boys on the trip.",10.0

"To find the number of kitchens on the space station, we need to first determine how many rooms are occupied by other types of rooms (bedrooms and bathrooms), and then see how many are left for kitchens.

Each cylindrical structure contains:
- 12 bedrooms
- 7 bathrooms

Therefore, each cylindrical structure has a total of:
12 (bedrooms) + 7 (bathrooms) = 19 rooms

The space station has three identical cylindrical structures, so the total number of bedrooms and bathrooms across the entire space station is:
19 rooms per structure * 3 structures = 57 rooms

The total number of rooms on the space station is 72. Therefore, the number of rooms that are kitchens is:
72 (total rooms) - 57 (bedrooms and bathrooms) = 15 kitchens

So, there are 15 kitchens on the entire space station.",15.0
"First, let's determine the total number of points scored by the 5 players who averaged 50 points each:

\[ 5 \text{ players} \times 50 \text{ points per player} = 250 \text{ points} \]

Next, we subtract these points from the team's total to find how many points were scored by the remaining players:

\[ 270 \text{ total points} - 250 \text{ points from 5 players} = 20 \text{ points} \]

There are 9 players on the team, and 5 have already been accounted for, so there are:

\[ 9 \text{ players} - 5 \text{ players} = 4 \text{ players} \]

These 4 players scored the remaining 20 points. To find the average points scored by each of these players, we divide the total points by the number of players:

"Let's work through the problem step by step:

1. We know there are 140 girls present. The problem states there are twice as many girls as boys present. Let's denote the number of boys present as \( B \). 

2. According to the problem, \( 2B = 140 \) (twice as many girls as boys).

3. Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 2: 
   \[
   B = \frac{140}{2} = 70

   So, there are 70 boys present.

4. The total number of students in the class is 250. Since there are 140 girls and 70 boys present, we can find the total number of students present:
   \[
   140 + 70 = 210

"First, we need to find the surface area of the moon. Given that the moon's surface area is \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the Earth's surface area and the Earth's surface area is 200 square acres, the surface area of the moon is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40 \text{ square acres}. \]

Next, we are told that the land on the moon is worth 6 times that of the land on Earth. We also know the total value of all the land on Earth is 80 billion dollars. To find the value of the land per square acre on Earth, we divide the total value by its surface area:

\[ \text{Value per square acre on Earth} = \frac{80 \text{ billion dollars}}{200 \text{ square acres}} = 0.4 \text{ billion dollars per square acre}. \]

Since the land on the moon is worth 6 times as much, the value per square acre on the moon is:

\[ 0.4 \text{ billion dollars per square acre} \times 6 = 2.4 \text{ billion dollars per square acre}. \]

Finally, to find the total value of all the land on the moon, we multiply the value per square acre by the moon's surface area:

The total number of chairs = 40  
Each chair has a capacity of 2 people, so the total capacity = 40 × 2 = 80 people.

Since 2/5 of the chairs were not occupied, we need to find out how many chairs were occupied:

Number of chairs not occupied = (2/5) × 40 = 16 chairs

Thus, the number of chairs that were occupied = 40 - 16 = 24 chairs

Since each of these 24 chairs had 2 people, the number of board members who attended the meeting is:

Number of board members who attended = 24 × 2 = 48 people

Therefore, 48 board members attended the meeting.",48.0

"To find the total distance Mairead covers during her exercises, let's break down the distances:

1. Mairead runs for 40 miles.
2. She walks for \(\frac{3}{5}\) times as many miles as she ran.

To calculate the walking distance:
\[
\text{Walking Distance} = \frac{3}{5} \times 40 = 24 \text{ miles}
\]

3. She walks for five times the number of miles she jogged.

We are not given the jogging distance directly, but based on the problem statement, she only runs and walks, so it implies that walking distance includes the jogging distance (?).

Since jogging is often considered part of running unless specified otherwise, let's confirm:

Let the jogging distance be \( x \).

Therefore, the walking distance is said to be 5 times the jogging distance:
\[
24 = 5x \implies x = \frac{24}{5} = 4.8 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, Mairead's total distance covered during her exercises is the sum of running and walking (which includes jogging):

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 40 (\text{running}) + 24 (\text{walking}) = 64 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance Mairead has covered while doing her exercises is 64 miles.",64.0

"To solve the problem, let's first establish the relationships and current counts of cards for Lloyd, Mark, and Michael.

1. Michael has 100 cards.
2. Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael, so Mark has 100 - 10 = 90 cards.
3. Mark has three times as many cards as Lloyd, so if Lloyd has \( x \) cards, then Mark has \( 3x \) cards. Since Mark has 90 cards, we can set up the equation: 

   \( 3x = 90 \)

   Solving for \( x \), we get:

   \( x = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \)

   Therefore, Lloyd has 30 cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards they currently have:

- Lloyd has 30 cards.
- Mark has 90 cards.
- Michael has 100 cards.

So the total number of cards they currently have is:

\( 30 + 90 + 100 = 220 \) cards.

They want to have a total of 300 cards. Therefore, they need to collect:

\( 300 - 220 = 80 \) more cards.

"First, let's calculate how much Timothy spends on the t-shirts and bags. 

He buys 2 t-shirts, each costing $8:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars for t-shirts} \]

He buys 2 bags, each costing $10:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars for bags} \]

So, the total amount Timothy spends on t-shirts and bags is:
\[ 16 + 20 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Timothy originally had $50, so the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 50 - 36 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Key chains sell 3 pieces for $2, which means each set of 3 pieces costs $2. Therefore, the number of sets Timothy can buy with the $14 he has left is:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set contains 3 pieces, the total number of key chain pieces he can buy is:
\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ pieces} \]

The answer is that Timothy can buy 21 pieces of key chains with the money he has left.",21.0
"First, let's determine the number of rabbits after the first spring.

1. **Number of Kittens Born in the First Spring**:  
   Lola has 10 breeding rabbits, and each had 10 times as many kittens as the number of breeding rabbits.  
   Thus, the number of kittens born = 10 breeding rabbits × 10 = 100 kittens.

2. **Kittens Adopted in the First Spring**:  
   Half of the 100 kittens got adopted, so 100 / 2 = 50 kittens were adopted.

3. **Kittens Returned Due to Re-homing Problems**:  
   5 kittens were returned to Lola.

4. **Kittens Remaining After First Spring**:  
   Originally, there were 100 kittens.  
   50 were adopted and 5 were returned:  
   100 - 50 (adopted) + 5 (returned) = 55 kittens remain.

Next, let's look at the second spring.

5. **Number of Kittens Born in the Second Spring**:  
   During the second spring, the breeding rabbits had 60 kittens.

6. **Kittens Adopted in the Second Spring**:  
   4 of the 60 kittens were adopted.

7. **Kittens Remaining After Second Spring**:

   To find the total number of rabbits, we add:  
   - The 10 breeding rabbits  
   - The 55 kittens remaining after the first spring  
   - The 56 kittens remaining after the second spring  

   Total = 10 (breeding rabbits) + 55 (kittens after the first spring) + 56 (kittens after the second spring) = 121 rabbits.

Therefore, Lola has 121 rabbits in her house.",121.0
"First, calculate the total cost incurred by the farmer:

- Corn seeds: $50
- Fertilizers and pesticides: $35
- Labor: $15

Total cost = $50 + $35 + $15 = $100

The farmer wants to make a profit of 10% on his total costs. To find out the selling price needed to achieve this profit, first calculate the desired profit:

Profit = 10% of total cost = 0.10 × $100 = $10

The total amount the farmer wants to earn (cost + profit) is:

Total earnings = Total cost + Profit = $100 + $10 = $110

The farmer has 10 bags of corn, so to find the selling price per bag, divide the total earnings by the number of bags:

Selling price per bag = Total earnings / Number of bags = $110 / 10 = $11

Therefore, the farmer should sell each bag of corn for $11 to make a 10% profit.",10.0

"First, let's calculate the time it takes to make one cake.

1. **Mixing time for one cake:** 12 minutes

2. **Baking time for one cake:** Baking takes 9 more minutes than mixing, so it takes 12 + 9 = 21 minutes.

3. **Cooling and decorating time for one cake:** This takes 6 more minutes than the baking time, so it takes 21 + 6 = 27 minutes.

Now, add all these times together to get the total time for one cake:
12 (mixing) + 21 (baking) + 27 (cooling and decorating) = 60 minutes

Since it takes 60 minutes to make one cake, for 6 cakes, it will take:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of each type of duck with variables:

- Let \( C \) be the number of Cayuga ducks.
- The number of Muscovy ducks is \( C + 4 \).
- The number of Khaki Campbell ducks is \( \frac{C + 4 - 3}{2} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{C + 1}{2} \), since there are 3 more than twice as many Cayugas as Khaki Campbells.

Given that the total number of ducks is 90, we can write the equation:

\[
C + (C + 4) + \frac{C + 1}{2} = 90
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
2C + 4 + \frac{C + 1}{2} = 90
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply through by 2:

\[
2(2C + 4) + C + 1 = 180

\[
4C + 8 + C + 1 = 180

Combine like terms:

\[
5C + 9 = 180
\]

Solving for \( C \):

\[
5C = 171
\]

\[
C = 34.2

This result doesn't make sense in the context of this problem as the number of ducks should be an integer. Let's re-evaluate the equations:

Consider that \( C + 4 = 2 \times \frac{C + 1}{2} + 3 \), which simplifies to:

\[
C + 4 = C + 1 + 3

This should validate to:

\[
C + 4 = 2C + 3 \Rightarrow C = 1

This contradiction suggests there may be a setup or transcription issue. Let's check and adjust assumptions:

If \( C \) (Cayugas) is less than twice that of Khaki Campbells correctly, and with no number yield the balance correctly to 90 up to inequality, recompute assumptions that might have been adapted in preference during overflow gen.

From question provided context assumes erroneously setup should check counter-balance attempts.

If solved by numeric modeling by correction, may be done: Else interpret for patterns known recompute.

"First, let's calculate the total area to be painted. Martha needs to paint all four walls of the kitchen.

1. Calculate the area of each wall:
   - There are two walls with dimensions 12 feet by 10 feet.
   - There are two walls with dimensions 16 feet by 10 feet.

2. Area of the two 12 x 10 walls:
   - Each wall has an area of 12 x 10 = 120 square feet.
   - Both walls together have an area of 2 x 120 = 240 square feet.

3. Area of the two 16 x 10 walls:
   - Each wall has an area of 16 x 10 = 160 square feet.
   - Both walls together have an area of 2 x 160 = 320 square feet.

4. Total area for all four walls:
   - Total area = 240 + 320 = 560 square feet.

Next, since each wall needs one coat of primer and two coats of paint, we need to account for these additional coats:

5. Total area to be painted considering primer and paint:
   - Total coats required = 1 primer coat + 2 paint coats = 3 coats.
   - Total area considering all coats = 560 square feet x 3 = 1,680 square feet.

Finally, calculate the time required to paint this total area:

6. Martha can paint at a rate of 40 square feet per hour. Therefore, the total time required:
   - Total time = Total area / Rate = 1,680 square feet / 40 square feet per hour = 42 hours.

Thus, it will take Martha 42 hours to paint the kitchen.",42.0
"Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine Olaf’s age:**
   - Beckett is 12 and is three years younger than Olaf.
   - Therefore, Olaf is 12 + 3 = 15 years old.

2. **Determine Shannen’s age:**
   - Shannen is two years younger than Olaf.
   - Therefore, Shannen is 15 - 2 = 13 years old.

3. **Determine Jack’s age:**
   - Jack is five more than twice as old as Shannen.
   - Twice Shannen's age is 2 × 13 = 26.
   - Five more than twice Shannen’s age is 26 + 5 = 31.

"Let's break down the information step by step.

1. There are 5 siblings, and their total height is 330 inches.
2. Two of the siblings are 66 inches tall each, so together they contribute \(66 + 66 = 132\) inches to the total height.
3. Another sibling is 60 inches tall, bringing the cumulative height to \(132 + 60 = 192\) inches.
4. Let \(x\) represent the height of the fourth sibling.

Let's set up an equation to solve for \(x\):
\[
192 + x + (x - 2) = 330
\]
This equation considers the height of Eliza being 2 inches shorter than this sibling \(x\).

Combine and simplify the equation:
\[
192 + x + x - 2 = 330

\[
2x + 190 = 330
\]
Subtract 190 from both sides:
\[
2x = 140

"Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Initially, there are 8 students enrolled.
2. 8 more students became interested, but a fourth of these (8 / 4 = 2) dropped out. So, 8 - 2 = 6 students joined, making the total 8 + 6 = 14 students.
3. 2 more students left, so the total is 14 - 2 = 12 students.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of American and European swallows in the flock.

Given that there are twice as many American swallows as European swallows, let the number of European swallows be \( x \). Therefore, the number of American swallows is \( 2x \).

Since the total number of swallows is 90, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + x = 90 \]

Solving for \( x \), we get:

\[ 3x = 90 \]

\[ x = 30 \]

So, there are 30 European swallows and \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) American swallows.

Next, we calculate the maximum weight each group of swallows can carry:

- Each American swallow can carry 5 pounds, so 60 American swallows can carry a total of:

  \[ 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ pounds} \]

- Each European swallow can carry twice the weight of an American swallow, which is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) pounds. Therefore, 30 European swallows can carry a total of:

"To determine when the ship should have departed, we need to work backwards from the expected arrival at the warehouse.

First, the cargo will arrive at the warehouse in 2 days from today. From that point, we need to account for the 7 days it takes from the port to the warehouse:

- 7 days ago from the warehouse arrival (which is 2 days from today), the cargo leaves the port.

Next, we account for the time the cargo spends in customs and regulatory processes at the port, which is 4 days:

- 4 more days ago from the port departure date, the ship arrives at the port.

Then, we account for the navigation time from Shanghai to Vancouver, which is 21 days:

- 21 more days ago from the port arrival date, the ship departs from Shanghai.

Now, adding all these periods together:

"First, we calculate the time John spends repairing the 3 cars that take 40 minutes each:

3 cars x 40 minutes per car = 120 minutes

Next, we determine the repair time for the remaining 2 cars, which take 50% longer:

50% of 40 minutes = 20 minutes

So, each of these 2 cars takes:

40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

Therefore, the time for the remaining 2 cars is:

2 cars x 60 minutes per car = 120 minutes

The total repair time for all 5 cars is:

120 minutes (first 3 cars) + 120 minutes (last 2 cars) = 240 minutes

Convert 240 minutes into hours:

"To find out how many wooden planks Andrew bought initially, let's break down the problem by space and instruction:

1. **Initial Plank Usage:**
   - Bedroom: 8 planks
   - Living Room: 20 planks
   - Kitchen: 11 planks
   - Guest Bedroom: Bedroom took 8 planks, so Guest Bedroom takes 2 fewer: 8 - 2 = 6 planks
   - Two Hallways: 4 planks each, so 4 + 4 = 8 planks

   Total initial planks used = 8 (Bedroom) + 20 (Living Room) + 11 (Kitchen) + 6 (Guest Bedroom) + 8 (Hallways) = 53 planks

2. **Replacements Due to Damage:**
   - Bedroom: Damaged 3 planks and replaced them with an additional 3 planks

"First, let's determine the selling price per DVD. Since each DVD costs $6 to make and James sells it for 2.5 times that amount:

Selling price per DVD = 2.5 × $6 = $15.

Next, calculate the profit per DVD. Profit per DVD is the selling price minus the cost to make each DVD:

Profit per DVD = $15 (selling price) - $6 (cost to make) = $9.

Now, calculate the number of DVDs sold in one week. James sells 500 DVDs a day for 5 days a week:

DVDs sold per week = 500 DVDs/day × 5 days/week = 2,500 DVDs/week.

Next, find out how many DVDs are sold in 20 weeks:

DVDs sold in 20 weeks = 2,500 DVDs/week × 20 weeks = 50,000 DVDs.

Calculate the total profit from selling these DVDs:

Total profit = 50,000 DVDs × $9 profit/DVD = $450,000.

Finally, deduct the initial cost of creating the movie:

Total profit after cost of movie = $450,000 - $2,000 = $448,000.

"To determine how many more boxes are needed to hold all the chocolates, we first need to figure out how many chocolates can fit in each box. However, this piece of information is not provided in the question. Let's assume that the boxes can each hold a certain number of chocolates (we will call this number \(x\)), and then find out the total number of chocolates that need to be placed in boxes.

Nida initially has 50 chocolates: those already in the boxes and the 5 that are not.

Since there are 3 filled boxes, the total number of chocolates in those boxes is \(50 - 5 = 45\).

Her friend brings 25 additional chocolates, so the total number of chocolates she now has is:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75. \]

Currently, 45 chocolates are in boxes. This means there are \((75 - 45) = 30\) chocolates that need to be placed in boxes.

To find out how many more boxes are needed, we can divide the 30 chocolates that need to be boxed by the capacity of each box (\(x\)). Without knowing the box capacity, we can use this equation:

\[ \text{Number of additional boxes needed} = \left\lceil \frac{30}{x} \right\rceil. \]

However, without the specific capacity of each box, we can't complete the calculation. If you provide this information (the capacity of each box), I can give you the precise number of additional boxes required.

"Initially, both the shark and the pilot fish were traveling at the same speed as Keanu, which was 20 miles per hour.

When the shark doubled its speed, it increased its speed by:

\[ 20 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 = 40 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the shark's new speed became 40 miles per hour.

The pilot fish increased its speed by half as much as the shark increased its speed. Since the shark increased its speed by 20 miles per hour (from 20 to 40 miles per hour), the pilot fish increased its speed by half of that:

\[ 20 \text{ miles per hour} \div 2 = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the pilot fish's new speed became:

"To find the total space Davonte's art collection takes up, we need to calculate the area of each set of paintings and then sum them up.

1. **Three 6-foot by 6-foot paintings**:  
   Each painting has an area of 6 feet x 6 feet = 36 square feet.  
   Therefore, the area for three paintings is 3 x 36 = 108 square feet.

2. **Four 2-foot by 3-foot paintings**:  
   Each painting has an area of 2 feet x 3 feet = 6 square feet.

"First, let's find out the cost of one plastic chair. We know that five plastic chairs cost $55. So, the cost of one plastic chair is:

\[ \text{Cost of one plastic chair} = \frac{55}{5} = 11 \text{ dollars.} \]

Next, let's determine the cost of a portable table. We know that three plastic chairs cost as much as one portable table. Therefore, the cost of a portable table is:

\[ \text{Cost of a portable table} = 3 \times 11 = 33 \text{ dollars.} \]

Now, Manny wants to buy one portable table and two chairs. Let's calculate the total cost of these items:

\[ \text{Cost of two chairs} = 2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ dollars.} \]

\[ \text{Total cost of a portable table and two chairs} = 33 + 22 = 55 \text{ dollars.} \]

"To find the total number of cards traded between Padma and Robert, we need to add up all the cards they exchanged.

1. Padma traded 2 valuable cards to Robert and received 10 cards from Robert.
2. Robert traded 8 cards to Padma and received 15 cards from Padma.

So, the total number of cards Padma and Robert traded with each other is:

- Padma traded: 2 (valuable) + 15 = 17 cards
- Robert traded: 10 + 8 = 18 cards

Since each card traded by one person corresponds to a card received by the other, we can simply choose one of the totals to represent the total number of transactions or exchanges. Each card exchanged is a transaction, so we look at one side of the trades without duplicating:

- Padma received 10 + 8 cards = 18 cards from Robert
- Robert received 2 + 15 cards = 17 cards from Padma

Hence, both perspectives (total exchanges/transfers considering person one and person two) should reveal a consistent total number of transactions—thus, analyzing from the perspective of a one-sided transactional tally would yield:

There were 17 + 18 = 35 total card exchanges when considering what they each traded away—thus representing exchange operations. However, because some exchanges were the same, both sides sent and received the same number of cards (two different transactions for a swap, even though counted differently in breakdown terms), they actually traded equal numbers so, we focus on number of cards exchanges corresponding exactly for both and focusing simply from one pattern is summed up for correct assessment of trade events:

The total number of cards exchanged in one set event across varied patterning (already seen was equal)—hence remained straightforwardly centralized:

Or simply put innate:

35 exchange events as just formalism to confirm dual exchange tally concerns the swaps mechanics

Thus transaction-wise:
  
They traded 35 cards between each other, considering, on different ""card-for-card"" concept-regardless being verifying/examinary previous exerted there same-way processes sides on different-wider frame card-context.

Upon scrutinizing for optimal purity precisions: Total unique has converged symmetrically towards matching card volumes exchange:

The number of unique card transaction counted directly complementary perspective results is 18 cards exchanged once balance refinements and one-side corollaries astutely reverted simply,
 
Unique transaction nature of parallel still: 18 stands from transactional further, same workings intent condensely

Therefore,
Padma received 18, Robert sent/received was 18, technically simplified within transactional practice specifically 

Thus finally concluding plain:
They traded a total of 18 cards between them considering systematic card trades using explicit understood dynamics 

---

So, considering earlier essential interchange tally consistent methodology:

18 exchanged operationally as cards between Padma and Robert through defined consistent interchange notational initially after systematic check pursued;

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total rate at which water is being delivered by all four hoses and then calculate how many hours it takes to fill the pool with a volume of 15,000 gallons.

1. **Calculate the total rate of water flow:**

   - The first two hoses each deliver 2 gallons per minute, so together they deliver:
     \[
     2 \text{ gallons/minute} + 2 \text{ gallons/minute} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute}
     \]
   
   - The other two hoses each deliver 3 gallons per minute, so together they deliver:
     \[
     3 \text{ gallons/minute} + 3 \text{ gallons/minute} = 6 \text{ gallons/minute}
     \]
   
   - The total rate of water flow from all hoses is:
     \[
     4 \text{ gallons/minute} + 6 \text{ gallons/minute} = 10 \text{ gallons/minute}
     \]

2. **Determine the time needed to fill the pool:**

   - The pool needs to be filled with 15,000 gallons of water.

   - To find the total time in minutes, divide the total volume by the total rate of flow:
     \[
     \frac{15,000 \text{ gallons}}{10 \text{ gallons/minute}} = 1,500 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**

   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{1,500 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 25 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 25 hours to fill the pool. The answer is 25.",25.0
"Let's begin by setting up the problem using algebra.

Let \( x \) represent the amount of money Frank initially had.

1. **Spent on groceries:**
   Frank spent \( \frac{1}{5} \) of his money on groceries, so the remaining money is:
   \[
   x - \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{4}{5}x
   \]

2. **Spent on the magazine:**
   Frank then spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining money on a magazine. He had \( \frac{4}{5}x \) left, so he spent:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{4}{5}x = \frac{1}{5}x
   \]
   Therefore, the remaining money after buying the magazine is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5}x - \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{3}{5}x
   \]

3. **Remaining money:**
   We are told that after all this, Frank has $360 left. Thus:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5}x = 360

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{3} \) to isolate \( x \):

                  = $12.00

Add the rush delivery cost to the original price to find the total cost with rush delivery:

Total cost with rush delivery = $40.00 + $12.00
                              = $52.00

Since there are 4 types of sliced meat in the pack, divide the total cost by 4 to find the cost per type of sliced meat:

Cost per type of sliced meat = $52.00 ÷ 4
                             = $13.00

Each type of sliced meat will cost $13.00 with rush shipping added.",13.0

Next, we determine how many sticks Micky's raft needs. Micky needs 9 sticks more than Simon and Gerry's rafts combined. First, we find the total number of sticks Simon and Gerry need:

\[ \text{Simon + Gerry's sticks} = 36 + 24 = 60 \text{ sticks} \]

So, Micky's raft needs:

\[ \text{Micky's sticks} = 60 + 9 = 69 \text{ sticks} \]

Finally, we add the number of sticks needed for all three rafts to find the total:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Understand their combined capacity per trip:**
   - Jack can carry 2 buckets per trip, with each bucket being 5 gallons, so Jack carries \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gallons per trip.
   - Jill can carry 1 bucket per trip, with each bucket being 5 gallons, so Jill carries 5 gallons per trip.

2. **Consider the time ratio:**
   - Jack completes 3 trips in the time Jill completes 2 trips.

3. **Find the water fetched in their combined trips (2 trips for Jill):**
   - In the time Jill makes 2 trips, she carries \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gallons in total.
   - Within the same time frame, Jack makes 3 trips: \(3 \times 10 = 30\) gallons.

4. **Total gallons carried by both in the equal time frame:**
   - Together, in this time frame, they carry \(10 + 30 = 40\) gallons.

"In Brian's separate collection, he has 40 grey stones and 60 green stones, so he has a ratio of grey to green stones of 40:60, or 2:3.

His collection of 100 stones (white and black stones) should maintain the same percentage distribution, meaning the ratio of white to black stones should also be 2:3. 

Let's assume the number of white stones is \(2x\) and the number of black stones is \(3x\). According to the problem, he has more white stones than black ones, which means \(2x > 3x\), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, we must explore \(2x\) and \(3x\) under the condition that the total equals 100 stones.

The equation \(2x + 3x = 100\) simplifies to \(5x = 100\).

Solving for \(x\), we get:

\[ x = 100 / 5 = 20. \]

Now, calculate the number of white and black stones:
- White stones: \(2x = 2 \times 20 = 40\).
- Black stones: \(3x = 3 \times 20 = 60\).

However, this configuration does not satisfy the condition that there are more white stones than black stones. Let's re-evaluate:

Reassessing the distribution:
The percentage of white stones in the collection must be greater than that of black stones, hence altering the original ratio while maintaining a workable percentage distribution, ensuring that the sum of their portions equals 100 stones.

Considering the limitation to input ratio:
The minimum condition sets the white stones at a bare minimum such differential could be 34 as follow

Evaluating percentage compatibility:

Trial solution (possible):
If total numbers were adjusted as per expectation give white stones more percentage:
- Set 40% for white stones in place of calculated:
  - White stones: \(40\) stones
  - Black stones: \(60 - 34 = 26\) stones

Summarily, suitable numbers honoring ratio subject:
- Number of white stones = 60.
- Number of black stones = 40.

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils used solely for drawing pictures. Each picture requires 4 pencils, and Alexander uses a total of 88 pencils for both drawing and signing.

Since each exhibition also requires 2 additional pencils for signature, let's calculate the pencils used for signatures. Alexander initially draws 9 pictures for the first exhibition, requiring 2 pencils for signing. For the 5 new galleries (or exhibitions), he will use an additional 2 pencils for each one.

Calculating the pencils used for signing:
- 1 initial exhibition: 2 pencils
- 5 new exhibitions: 5 * 2 = 10 pencils

Total pencils used for signing:
2 + 10 = 12 pencils

Now, let’s subtract the pencils used for signing from the total pencils used:
88 total pencils - 12 pencils for signing = 76 pencils for drawing

Since each picture takes 4 pencils for drawing:
76 pencils / 4 pencils per picture = 19 pictures drawn in total

Alexander drew 9 pictures for the initial exhibition. Therefore, the number of pictures drawn for the 5 new galleries is:
19 pictures (total) - 9 pictures (initial exhibition) = 10 pictures for new galleries

Since the 10 pictures are evenly distributed among 5 new galleries:
10 pictures / 5 galleries = 2 pictures per gallery

Therefore, there are 2 paintings at each of the 5 new galleries.",5.0

"First, we need to calculate how much she needs to add to each employee's current salary to reach $35,000. Each employee currently makes $20,000, so Emily needs to add $35,000 - $20,000 = $15,000 extra per employee.

With 10 employees, the total additional amount needed is 10 employees × $15,000 = $150,000.

Emily originally makes $1,000,000 per year. If she uses $150,000 of her salary to increase her employees' salaries, her new salary would be $1,000,000 - $150,000 = $850,000.

"To find out how much Samantha would have saved by paying cash, we need to calculate the total cost she paid in installments and compare it to the cash price.

1. **Cash Price**: $8000

2. **Installments**:
   - Deposit: $3000
   - Monthly installments: $300 each for 30 months.

   Total cost from installments = Deposit + (Monthly installment × Number of months)

   Total cost = $3000 + ($300 × 30)

"First, let's calculate the total round-trip distance per day. Since the one-way distance is 21 miles, the round-trip distance is:

\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we determine the number of miles driven per week:

\[ 42 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 210 \, \text{miles/week} \]

Over a month (4 weeks), the total miles driven are:

\[ 210 \, \text{miles/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 840 \, \text{miles/month} \]

Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, so the total gallons of gas used monthly are:

\[ \frac{840 \, \text{miles}}{30 \, \text{miles/gallon}} = 28 \, \text{gallons} \]

With gas costing $2.50 per gallon, the total monthly gas cost is:

\[ 28 \, \text{gallons} \times \$2.50/\text{gallon} = \$70 \]

The five friends will cover this cost, so each person pays:

\[ \frac{\$70}{5} = \$14 \]

Therefore, each person pays $14 toward gas monthly.",14.0
"Let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income as \( x \).

1. Initially, Mrs. Snyder spent 40% of her income on rent and utilities. This can be represented as:
   \[
   0.4x
   \]

2. After the salary increase of $600, her new income becomes:
   \[
   x + 600
   \]

3. With the new income, her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her monthly income:
   \[
   0.25(x + 600)
   \]

Since the amount spent on rent and utilities remains unchanged, we set the two expressions equal:
\[
0.4x = 0.25(x + 600)
\]

4. Expanding the equation on the right side:
   \[
   0.4x = 0.25x + 150
   \]

5. Subtract \( 0.25x \) from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   0.4x - 0.25x = 150

   \[
   0.15x = 150

Thus, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1,000.",1000.0
"Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Starting Point:** Five years ago, there were 500 old books in the library.

2. **Books Added Two Years Ago:** The librarian bought 300 books two years ago, so the total number of books becomes 500 + 300 = 800 books.

3. **Books Added Last Year:** Last year, the librarian bought 100 more books than she bought two years ago. Since she bought 300 books two years ago, last year she bought 300 + 100 = 400 books. Adding these to the total, we have 800 + 400 = 1,200 books.

4. **Books Donated This Year:** This year, the librarian donated 200 of the library's old books. So, the total number of books now is 1,200 - 200 = 1,000 books.

- Mark brings in 4 times as many cans as Jaydon, which means Mark has \( 4(2R + 5) \) cans.

Since the total number of cans brought in is 135, we can set up the following equation:

   - Speed of second plane: 600 MPH - 120 MPH = 480 MPH

3. The third plane has 40 passengers. Each passenger slows down the plane by 2 MPH, so:
   - Speed reduction: 40 passengers × 2 MPH = 80 MPH
   - Speed of third plane: 600 MPH - 80 MPH = 520 MPH

Now, calculate the average speed of the three planes:
- Average speed = (500 MPH + 480 MPH + 520 MPH) / 3
- Average speed = 1500 MPH / 3
- Average speed = 500 MPH

The average speed of the three planes is 500 MPH.",500.0
"To find out how many more centimeters of snow Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot received compared to Bald Mountain, we need to perform the following calculations:

1. Convert the snow received on Bald Mountain from meters to centimeters:  
   Bald Mountain received 1.5 meters of snow. Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters:  
   \(1.5 \, \text{meters} = 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \, \text{centimeters}\).

2. Convert the snow received on Billy Mountain from meters to centimeters:  
   Billy Mountain received 3.5 meters of snow.  
   \(3.5 \, \text{meters} = 3.5 \times 100 = 350 \, \text{centimeters}\).

3. Calculate the total snow received on Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot together:  
   Billy Mountain received 350 centimeters and Mount Pilot received 126 centimeters.  
   \(350 + 126 = 476 \, \text{centimeters}\).

4. Find the difference in snow received between Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot combined, and Bald Mountain:  
   Total for Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot = 476 centimeters.  
   Bald Mountain = 150 centimeters.  
   \(476 - 150 = 326 \, \text{centimeters}\).

Therefore, Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot received 326 more centimeters of snow than Bald Mountain. The answer is 326.",326.0

"To determine how many hours Alex needs to hang upside down each month to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Determine Height Needed:**
   Alex needs to be 54 inches tall, and he is currently 48 inches tall. Therefore, he needs to grow:
   \[
   54 - 48 = 6 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Time Frame:**
   We assume ""next year"" means in 12 months, so Alex has 12 months to grow 6 inches.

3. **Normal Growth Per Month:**
   Normally, Alex grows \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an inch per month. Over 12 months, he will grow:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Additional Growth Needed:**
   To reach a total of 6 inches in growth, Alex needs an additional:
   \[
   6 - 4 = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Growth from Hanging Upside Down:**
   Alex hears he can grow \(\frac{1}{12}\) of an inch per hour hanging upside down.

6. **Calculate Hours Needed:**
   To achieve an additional 2 inches, hanging upside down, Alex needs:
   \[
   2 \text{ inches} \times \left(\frac{12 \text{ hours}}{1 \text{ inch}}\right) = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Hours Per Month:**
   If Alex needs a total of 24 hours hanging upside down spread over 12 months, he needs:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ months}} = 2 \text{ hours per month}
   \]

Therefore, Alex needs to hang upside down for an average of 2 hours each month to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster next year.",2.0

"To calculate the total cost of the decorations for Nathan's wedding reception, we need to find the cost for each component and then sum them up for all the tables.

1. **Cost of Linen Tablecloths**:
   - Each table needs a tablecloth which costs $25 to rent.
   - Number of tables = 20.
   - Total cost for tablecloths = 20 tables × $25/table = $500.

2. **Cost of Place Settings**:
   - Each table needs 4 place settings, each costing $10 to rent.
   - Cost per table for place settings = 4 settings × $10/setting = $40.
   - Total cost for place settings for all tables = 20 tables × $40/table = $800.

3. **Cost of Centerpieces**:
   - Each centerpiece consists of 10 roses and 15 lilies.
   - Cost of roses per centerpiece = 10 roses × $5/rose = $50.
   - Cost of lilies per centerpiece = 15 lilies × $4/lily = $60.
   - Total cost per centerpiece = $50 (roses) + $60 (lilies) = $110.
   - Total cost for centerpieces for all tables = 20 tables × $110/centerpiece = $2,200.

Finally, we add up all the individual costs to find the total cost of the decorations:

- Total cost for tablecloths = $500.
- Total cost for place settings = $800.
- Total cost for centerpieces = $2,200.

Total cost for decorations = $500 + $800 + $2,200 = $3,500.

So, the total cost of the decorations will be $3,500.",3500.0

"To solve the problem, let's first understand the total number of flowers sold in terms of rose and daisy bouquets.

The flower shop sells:
- 10 bouquets of roses, with each bouquet containing 12 roses. So the total number of roses sold is:
  \[
  10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ roses}

We know that the total number of flowers sold is 190. Therefore, the number of daisies sold can be found by subtracting the number of roses from the total number of flowers:
\[
190 - 120 = 70 \text{ daisies}
\]

Since there are 10 daisy bouquets and each bouquet contains the same number of daisies, we can find the number of daisies per bouquet by dividing the total number of daisies by the number of daisy bouquets:
\[
70 \div 10 = 7 \text{ daisies per bouquet}

"First, we need to determine how much Purity pays. We know that Rose's share is three times Purity's share:

\[ \text{Rose's share} = 3 \times \text{Purity's share} \]

Given that Rose's share is $1,800:

\[ 1,800 = 3 \times \text{Purity's share} \]

Dividing both sides by 3 gives the amount Purity pays:

"To find out how much Porter will earn in a month with the extra work, we need to calculate his earnings for both regular and overtime work.

1. **Regular Earnings Per Week:**
   - Porter earns $8 per day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings without overtime: \(8 \times 5 = 40\) dollars.

2. **Overtime Earnings Per Week:**
   - Overtime earnings: 50% more than his daily rate of $8.
   - 50% of $8 is \(0.5 \times 8 = 4\).
   - Overtime daily rate is \(8 + 4 = 12\) dollars.
   - So, for 1 extra day of overtime: \(12 \times 1 = 12\) dollars.

3. **Total Weekly Earnings:**
   - Adding his regular earnings with his overtime earnings: \(40 + 12 = 52\) dollars per week.

4. **Monthly Earnings:**
   - There are typically 4 weeks in a month.
   - So, his total earnings per month: \(52 \times 4 = 208\) dollars.

Porter will earn $208 after a month if he works overtime every week.",208.0
"To determine how many ice cream cones Marco needs to sell to make a $200 profit, we first need to calculate the necessary total sales.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of ice cream cones sold, each at $5.
2. Total sales from selling \( x \) cones would be \( 5x \) dollars.
3. Marco's expenses are 80% of total sales, therefore his expenses are \( 0.8 \times 5x = 4x \) dollars.
4. The profit is defined as total sales minus expenses. So, the profit is \( 5x - 4x = x \) dollars.
5. We want the profit to be $200, so we set up the equation:

"First, we calculate the total number of cookies John makes. Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, he makes:

6 dozen × 12 cookies per dozen = 72 cookies.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the cookies:

72 cookies × $1.50 per cookie = $108.

Now, we determine the total cost to make the cookies:

72 cookies × $0.25 per cookie = $18.

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

$108 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $90 (profit).

Since John splits the profit evenly between two charities, each charity gets:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of true/false questions.
- \( y \) as the number of free response questions.
- \( z \) as the number of multiple choice questions.

According to the problem:
1. The total number of problems is 45:

"To find the percentage of gingerbread cookies with red hats, we first need to determine the total number of gingerbread cookies that have red hats. Anna gives 6 gingerbread cookies red hats. 

Now, to find the percentage, we need to know the total number of gingerbread cookies. Based on the given information:

- 6 cookies have red hats.
- 9 cookies have blue boots.
- 3 cookies have both red hats and blue boots.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we calculate the total number of cookies as follows:

Total = (Cookies with red hats) + (Cookies with blue boots) - (Cookies with both red hats and blue boots)
       = 6 + 9 - 3
       = 12

Now, to find the percentage of cookies with red hats:

Percentage with red hats = (Number of cookies with red hats / Total number of cookies) × 100
                         = (6 / 12) × 100

"Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. The number of employees hired in the fourth week is 400.
2. The number of employees hired in the third week is half of what was hired in the fourth week, since the fourth week hired twice the number in the third week. Therefore, the number hired in the third week is 400 / 2 = 200.
3. The second week hired 150 fewer employees than the third week. So, the number of employees hired in the second week is 200 - 150 = 50.
4. The first week hired 200 more employees than the second week. Therefore, the number of employees hired in the first week is 50 + 200 = 250.

Now, let's find the total number of employees hired over the four weeks and calculate the average:

- First week: 250 employees
- Second week: 50 employees
- Third week: 200 employees
- Fourth week: 400 employees

Total number of employees hired = 250 + 50 + 200 + 400 = 900

"To find out how many days it will take for the toothpaste to run out, we first need to determine the total amount of toothpaste the family uses each day.

- Anne's dad uses 3 grams per brushing. Since he brushes 3 times a day, he uses 3 grams/brush × 3 times/day = 9 grams/day.
- Anne's mom uses 2 grams per brushing. Since she brushes 3 times a day, she uses 2 grams/brush × 3 times/day = 6 grams/day.
- Anne uses 1 gram per brushing. Since she brushes 3 times a day, she uses 1 gram/brush × 3 times/day = 3 grams/day.
- Anne's brother also uses 1 gram per brushing. Since he brushes 3 times a day, he uses 1 gram/brush × 3 times/day = 3 grams/day.

1. Molly has two parents.
2. Molly has three brothers, and each brother is married, which means Molly also has three sisters-in-law (one for each brother).
3. Additionally, each brother has 2 children, which makes a total of \(3 \times 2 = 6\) children.

Now we add all the relatives together:
- Parents: 2
- Brothers: 3
- Sisters-in-law: 3
- Nephews and nieces: 6

Total number of relatives = \(2 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 14\).

Since it costs Molly $5 to send one package, the total cost to send gifts to all 14 relatives is:
\[14 \times 5 = 70\] dollars.

Therefore, it costs Molly $70 to send all the gifts by mail to her relatives.",70.0
"Let's establish variables to solve the problem:

Let \( x \) be the amount of fertilizer used in gallons. Since seed is three times as much as fertilizer, the amount of seed used will be \( 3x \).

According to the problem, the total amount of seed and fertilizer combined is 60 gallons. This gives us the equation:

\[ x + 3x = 60 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4x = 60 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Carson uses 15 gallons of fertilizer. Since the seed is three times the amount of fertilizer, Carson uses:

Therefore, Carson uses 45 gallons of seed.",45.0
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine which cards in a standard deck meet the criteria: being red and having a number divisible by 3.

A standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Red cards consist of the hearts and diamonds suits, making 26 red cards in total.

The number cards in each suit are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

However, Marcus removes all the face cards (Jack, Queen, King) and the 8s from the deck. Thus, only number cards (2-10 excluding 8s) remain.

Next, identify numbers divisible by 3 within the available number cards of the red suits:

- 3 is divisible by 3.
- 6 is divisible by 3.
- 9 is divisible by 3.

So, for each red suit (hearts and diamonds), the cards that are both red and divisible by 3 are: 3, 6, and 9. That makes a total of 3 cards per red suit.

Since there are 2 red suits (hearts and diamonds), there are 3 (hearts) + 3 (diamonds) = 6 such cards in total for the entire deck.

The total number of cards in the deck, after removing the face cards and the 8s, would be:

- 52 total cards - 12 face cards (3 each of hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) - 4 eight cards (one each of hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) = 36 cards remaining.

Now, the probability \( P \) of picking a red number card divisible by 3 from this deck is:

\[ P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \]

If Mark picks a card at random 36 times, the expected number of times he picks a card that is both red and divisible by 3 is given by:

\[ 36 \times \frac{1}{6} = 6 \]

So, Mark should expect to pick a red card with a number divisible by 3 six times.",3.0

\[ 10 \text{ machines} \times 30 \text{ ball bearings/machine} = 300 \text{ ball bearings} \]

Next, calculate the cost without any discounts (i.e., buying them each at $1):

\[ 300 \text{ ball bearings} \times $1/\text{ball bearing} = $300 \]

Now, calculate the cost with the sale price of $0.75 per ball bearing before any additional discounts:

\[ 300 \text{ ball bearings} \times $0.75/\text{ball bearing} = $225 \]

Since he receives a further 20% discount for buying in bulk, calculate the additional discount on the $225 sale price:

\[ 20\% \times $225 = 0.20 \times $225 = $45 \]

Subtract the additional discount from the sale price to find the final cost:

\[ $225 - $45 = $180 \]

Finally, calculate the savings by comparing the original cost without any discounts to the final cost:

\[ $300 - $180 = $120 \]

John saved $120 by buying all the ball bearings during the sale rather than one at a time.",120.0

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The party guests ate half of the cake. This means half of the cake was left after the party.
2. The next day, Donna shared half of the leftover cake with her brothers. This means she kept half of the leftover half, which is a quarter of the original cake.
3. The following day, she ate one piece as a midnight snack.
4. After eating her midnight snack, there were twice as many pieces left as the piece she ate for her snack. This means if she ate one piece, two pieces were left.

Since there were two pieces left after she ate one piece, before the midnight snack, there must have been 2 (left) + 1 (snack) = 3 pieces.

We know that Donna was left with a quarter of the original cake before she ate the midnight snack. Thus:

- One-fourth of the cake was 3 pieces, so the cake had 4 quarters, meaning:

4 (quarters) × 3 (pieces per quarter) = 12 pieces in the original cake.

Therefore, the cake was 12 pieces to begin with.",12.0
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( x \) represent the initial number of marbles Archie had. 
2. Archie loses 60% of his marbles, so he retains 40%. Therefore, the number of marbles he has after this loss is \( 0.4x \).
3. Of the remaining marbles, he loses half down a sewer, so he is left with half of 40% which is \( 0.5 \times 0.4x = 0.2x \).

According to the problem, Archie has 20 marbles left, so:

\[
0.2x = 20
\]

To find the initial number of marbles he started with, solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{20}{0.2} = 100
\]

Thus, Archie initially had 100 marbles.",100.0
"First, let's calculate how much Mell spent. She ordered two cups of coffee and one piece of cake:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the food. Since there are 50 people and each person gets $3 worth of food, the total cost of the food is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Next, we need to find the combined cost of the actors and the food:

\[ 1200 + 150 = 1350 \]

The problem states that the equipment rental costs twice as much as the food and actors combined, so the cost of the equipment rental is:

\[ 2 \times 1350 = 2700 \]

Now, let's calculate the total expenses by adding up the costs of actors, food, and equipment rental:

\[ 1200 + 150 + 2700 = 4050 \]

The movie was sold for $10,000, so the revenue is $10,000. To find the profit, subtract the total expenses from the revenue:

"To determine how many gallons are missing for the tank to be at maximum capacity, let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - The tank is initially filled to its maximum capacity of 350,000 gallons.

2. **First Leakage Phase:**
   - The tank loses 32,000 gallons per hour for 5 hours.
   - Total gallons lost in this phase = 32,000 gallons/hour × 5 hours = 160,000 gallons.

3. **After First Leakage Phase:**
   - Remaining amount in the tank = 350,000 gallons - 160,000 gallons = 190,000 gallons.

4. **Second Leakage Phase:**
   - After repairs, the tank continues to lose 10,000 gallons per hour for 10 hours.
   - Total gallons lost in this phase = 10,000 gallons/hour × 10 hours = 100,000 gallons.

5. **After Second Leakage Phase:**
   - Remaining amount in the tank = 190,000 gallons - 100,000 gallons = 90,000 gallons.

6. **Filling the Tank:**
   - The tank is filled at a rate of 40,000 gallons per hour for 3 hours.
   - Total gallons added = 40,000 gallons/hour × 3 hours = 120,000 gallons.

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of Tom's medical expenses. The doctor visit costs $300 and the cast costs $200. 

Total cost = $300 + $200 = $500.

Next, we calculate the amount covered by insurance. Insurance covers 60% of the total cost, so:

Amount covered by insurance = 60% of $500 = 0.60 × $500 = $300.

Finally, to find Tom's out-of-pocket cost, we subtract the amount covered by insurance from the total cost:

Out-of-pocket cost = Total cost - Amount covered by insurance = $500 - $300 = $200.

So, Tom's out-of-pocket cost is $200.",200.0
"To find out how many hours Mr. Willson worked from Monday to Friday, we'll add up the hours he worked each day.

First, let's convert the fraction hours to a common denominator so they can be added easily:

- Monday: \( \frac{3}{4} \) hour
- Tuesday: \( \frac{1}{2} \) hour can be converted to \( \frac{2}{4} \) hour
- Wednesday: \( \frac{2}{3} \) hour can be converted to \( \frac{8}{12} \) hour
- Thursday: \( \frac{5}{6} \) hour can be converted to \( \frac{10}{12} \) hour
- Friday: 75 minutes, which is \( \frac{75}{60} = \frac{5}{4} \) hour

Let's find a common denominator for these fractions: 12 is a common multiple for 4, 3, 6, and 12.

Convert all fraction hours into twelfths:

- Monday: \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \) hour
- Tuesday: \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{6}{12} \) hour
- Wednesday: \( \frac{8}{12} \) hour
- Thursday: \( \frac{10}{12} \) hour
- Friday: \( \frac{5}{4} = \frac{15}{12} \) hour

Now, add up all the fractions:

\[
\frac{9}{12} + \frac{6}{12} + \frac{8}{12} + \frac{10}{12} + \frac{15}{12} = \frac{48}{12}
\]

\(\frac{48}{12} = 4\) hours.

Therefore, Mr. Willson worked a total of 4 hours from Monday to Friday.",4.0
"First, we calculate the total number of roses in Mrs. Dawson's garden:  
10 rows × 20 roses per row = 200 roses.

Next, we determine the number of red roses:   
1/2 of 200 = 100 red roses.

We then find the number of remaining roses after accounting for the red ones:  
200 - 100 = 100 roses remaining.

Now, we calculate the number of white roses, which is 3/5 of the remaining roses:  
3/5 of 100 = 60 white roses.

Finally, we find the number of pink roses, which are the roses left after accounting for the red and white ones:  
100 (remaining roses) - 60 (white roses) = 40 pink roses.

So, there are 40 pink roses in Mrs. Dawson's rose garden.",40.0
"First, calculate the cost of the contractor: 

The contractor costs $150 per hour, and he works for 3 days at 5 hours per day. 

\[ 
\text{Total contractor cost} = 150 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 2,250 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, calculate the inspector's cost:

The inspector's cost is 80% less than the contractor's total cost:

80% less means paying 20% of the contractor's cost:

\[ 
\text{Inspector's cost} = 0.20 \times 2,250 = 450 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Finally, calculate the total cost:

The total cost includes the permits, the contractor, and the inspector:

\[ 
\text{Total cost} = 250 \, \text{dollars (permit)} + 2,250 \, \text{dollars (contractor)} + 450 \, \text{dollars (inspector)} = 2,950 \, \text{dollars}

"First, we calculate the number of zebra enclosures. There are 4 tiger enclosures, and behind each tiger enclosure are 2 zebra enclosures. Therefore, the number of zebra enclosures is:

\[ 4 \, \text{tiger enclosures} \times 2 \, \text{zebra enclosures per tiger} = 8 \, \text{zebra enclosures} \]

Next, we determine the number of giraffe enclosures. There are three times as many giraffe enclosures as zebra enclosures, so:

\[ 8 \, \text{zebra enclosures} \times 3 = 24 \, \text{giraffe enclosures} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of animals in the zoo:

- Each tiger enclosure holds 4 tigers, so the total number of tigers is:

\[ 4 \, \text{tigers/enclosure} \times 4 \, \text{tiger enclosures} = 16 \, \text{tigers} \]

- Each zebra enclosure holds 10 zebras, so the total number of zebras is:

"Let's define the variables:

- Let \( P \) be Pam's current age.
- Let \( R \) be Rena's current age.

According to the problem, Pam is currently twice as young as Rena, which can be interpreted as Pam's age being half of Rena's age:

\[ P = \frac{R}{2} \]

In 10 years, Rena will be 5 years older than Pam, so:

\[ R + 10 = P + 10 + 5 \]

Substitute the expression for \( P \) from the first equation into the second:

\[ R + 10 = \frac{R}{2} + 15 \]

Now, solve for \( R \):

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the apartment. It is 16 feet by 10 feet, so the total area is:

\[ 16 \times 10 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 6 rooms in total and the living room is as big as 3 other rooms, this means the living room takes up as much space as three of the other rooms combined.

Let the size of each smaller room be \( x \) square feet. Then, the living room would be \( 3x \) square feet in size. With 5 other rooms of size \( x \), and one living room of \( 3x \), the equation for the total area would be:

\[ 5x + 3x = 160 \]
\[ 8x = 160 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{160}{8} = 20 \]

So each of the smaller rooms is 20 square feet. The living room, being as large as 3 of these smaller rooms, would be:

"To solve this, we start by determining how many books Matt read in the first year and then proceed to calculate the number of books Pete read across both years.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of books Matt read in the first year.

2. Pete read twice as many books as Matt in the first year, so he read \( 2x \) books.

3. In the second year, Matt read 75 books, which is 50% more than what he read in the first year, so:
   \[
   1.5x = 75
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{75}{1.5} = 50
   \]
   Thus, Matt read 50 books in the first year.

4. Therefore, Pete read \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) books in the first year.

5. In the second year, Pete doubles the number he read in the first year, so he read:
   \[
   2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   books in the second year.

6. Total books Pete read across both years:
   \[
   100 + 200 = 300

"First, let's calculate the cost of hiring the clown. The clown charges $100 per hour for 4 hours:

\[ 100 \times 4 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of renting the bounce house. The bounce house is rented for half the time, which is 2 hours (half of 4 hours), and it costs 3 times as much per hour:

Hourly rate for bounce house = \( 3 \times 100 = 300 \text{ dollars} \)

Cost for 2 hours = \( 300 \times 2 = 600 \text{ dollars} \)

Finally, we add the costs together, including the additional $1000 for everything else:

Total cost = $400 (clown) + $600 (bounce house) + $1000 (everything else) 

Total cost = $2000

Therefore, Tim's birthday party cost a total of $2000.",2000.0

Given that Dave has $46, we can calculate:

3 times Dave's amount = 3 × 46 = $138

Now, subtract $12 from this amount to find Kyle’s amount before spending:

Kyle's initial amount = $138 - $12 = $126

Next, Kyle spends a third of his money going snowboarding. We calculate a third of Kyle's initial amount:

One third of $126 = $126 ÷ 3 = $42

Tom's steps = 25 steps per minute × 11 minutes = 275 steps.

So by the time Matt has reached 220 steps, Tom will have gone up 275 steps.",275.0
"To find the total number of students at the competition, we need to determine the number of students from each school and then sum these numbers.

1. **Know It All High School:** There are 50 students from this school.

2. **Karen High School:** The number of students from Karen High is \( \frac{3}{5} \) times the number of students from Know It All High School. So, the number of students from Karen High is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \) students.

3. **Novel Corona High School:** The number of students from this school is twice the combined number of students from the other two schools. The combined number of students from the first two schools is \( 50 + 30 = 80 \). Therefore, the number of students from Novel Corona High School is \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \).

Finally, we calculate the total number of students at the competition:

Total students = Students from Know It All High + Students from Karen High + Students from Novel Corona High
Total students = \( 50 + 30 + 160 = 240 \).

Thus, the total number of students at the competition is 240.",240.0

Next, calculate the cost of the blue cheese. Since the blue cheese is packaged at 200 grams per package, and Miley buys 600 grams, she buys:

600 grams ÷ 200 grams/package = 3 packages

The cost of the blue cheese is:

3 packages × $8/package = $24

Now, calculate the amount of white cheese. Miley buys one-third less white cheese than the swiss cheese she bought. She bought 5 packs of swiss cheese, so one-third less means:

5 packs - (1/3 × 5 packs) = 5 packs - 1.67 packs ≈ 3.33 packs

Note: Since she can't buy a part of a package, we would normally round to the nearest whole number, but let's assume she buys exactly 3.33 packs for calculation purposes.

Therefore, the cost of the white cheese is:

3.33 packs × $5/pack = $16.65

Finally, add the costs together to find out how much Miley paid for all the cheese:

"To find out how many snowflakes there were initially, we need to determine how many snowflakes were added over the course of 1 hour.

Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, and snowflakes are added every 5 minutes, we need to calculate how many 5-minute intervals there are in 60 minutes:  
\[ 
\text{Number of 5-minute intervals} = \frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

It snowed an additional 4 snowflakes every 5 minutes, so over 12 intervals, the total number of additional snowflakes is:  
\[ 
\text{Total additional snowflakes} = 4 \times 12 = 48

If there were 58 snowflakes after 1 hour, we can find the initial number of snowflakes by subtracting the number of additional snowflakes from the final number:  
\[ 
\text{Initial number of snowflakes} = 58 - 48 = 10
\]

"To find out how many pens are in Sam's collection, we can start by identifying the number of each type of writing instrument:

1. **Pencils:** Sam has 8 pencils.

2. **Blue Pens:** There are twice as many blue pens as pencils. Therefore, the number of blue pens is 2 times 8, which equals 16 blue pens.

3. **Black Pens:** Sam has ten more black pens than blue pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is 16 (blue pens) + 10 = 26 black pens.

4. **Red Pens:** There are two fewer red pens than pencils. Therefore, the number of red pens is 8 (pencils) - 2 = 6 red pens.

Now, we can find the total number of pens by adding the blue, black, and red pens together:

- Blue pens: 16
- Black pens: 26
- Red pens: 6

Total pens = 16 + 26 + 6 = 48 pens

"First, calculate the total cost to purchase the cattle:  
- James buys 100 head of cattle for $40,000.

Then, calculate the cost to feed them:  
- The feeding cost is 20% more than the purchase cost.
- Feeding cost = 20% of $40,000 = 0.20 * $40,000 = $8,000.

Total cost (purchase + feeding):  
- Total cost = $40,000 + $8,000 = $48,000.

Next, calculate the revenue from selling the cattle:  
- Each cow weighs 1,000 pounds, and there are 100 cows, so the total weight is 100 * 1,000 = 100,000 pounds.
- Selling price is $2 per pound.
- Total revenue = 100,000 pounds * $2 per pound = $200,000.

Finally, calculate the profit:

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The number of cannoneers is given as 63.

2. The number of women is double the number of cannoneers, so there are 2 * 63 = 126 women.

3. The total number of men is twice the number of women, so there are 2 * 126 = 252 men.

4. To find the total number of people, we add the number of cannoneers, women, and men:

   - Cannoneers: 63
   - Women: 126
   - Men: 252

   Total = 63 + 126 + 252 = 441

Therefore, there are 441 people in total.",441.0
"To find the total production of televisions by the factory in the second year, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total production in the first year:
   - The factory produced televisions at a rate of 10 per day.
   - There are 365 days in a year, so the total production in the first year is:
     \[
     10 \, \text{televisions/day} \times 365 \, \text{days} = 3650 \, \text{televisions}
     \]

2. Then calculate the reduction amount for the second year:
   - The production was reduced by 10%.
   - 10% of the first year's production is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 3650 = 365 \, \text{televisions}
     \]

3. Finally, calculate the total production in the second year by subtracting the reduction from the first year's production:
   \[
   3650 - 365 = 3285 \, \text{televisions}

Therefore, the total production of televisions by the factory in the second year is 3285.",3285.0
"To find out how many toothbrushes the dental office gives away in a 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many patients visit in one 8-hour day:
   - Each visit takes 0.5 hours, so the number of visits per day is \( \frac{8}{0.5} = 16 \) patients per day.

2. Calculate how many toothbrushes are given in one day:
   - Since the office gives 2 toothbrushes to each patient, the number of toothbrushes given per day is \( 16 \text{ patients} \times 2 \text{ toothbrushes per patient} = 32 \text{ toothbrushes} \).

3. Determine the number of toothbrushes given in a 5-day work week:
   - The number of toothbrushes given in a week is \( 32 \text{ toothbrushes per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 160 \text{ toothbrushes} \).

"First, let's determine how many seconds it takes for each person to fold one small box and one medium box:

- Hugo can fold a small box in 3 seconds and a medium box in twice that time, which is 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
- Tom can fold both a small and a medium box in 4 seconds in total.

Now, let's calculate the time needed for Hugo and Tom to fold the boxes:

1. **Small Boxes:**

   - Hugo can fold 2400 small boxes in 3 * 2400 = 7200 seconds.
   - Tom can fold 2400 small boxes as part of a pair with medium boxes, but since he's faster overall, let's see how many pairs he can fold. First, we'll look at their joint efforts in combining their tasks in terms of pairs:

2. **Medium Boxes:**

   - Hugo can fold 1800 medium boxes in 6 * 1800 = 10800 seconds.
   - If Tom were to fold 1800 medium boxes as part of a pair with small boxes, let's see in combination:

Now, let's consider how efficiently they can split the work:

- Tom can fold one pair (1 small + 1 medium) in 4 seconds. Given that there are 1800 medium boxes, Tom can fold 1800 pairs in 4 * 1800 = 7200 seconds.

At the same time:
- While Tom is folding 1800 pairs (covering 1800 small and 1800 medium boxes), Hugo can continue working on the remaining 600 small boxes since there are 2400 small boxes in total.

- Hugo has the remaining 600 small boxes. Since he folds one small box in 3 seconds: 3 * 600 = 1800 seconds.

In conclusion, the time taken for them to finish the folding together is determined by the longest task at hand because they work independently:

Therefore, the total time for them to complete the task together is `max(7200, 1800)` = 7200 seconds.

The answer is 7200 seconds.",7200.0

"Let's use variables to solve the problem.

Let:
- \( S_{t} \) represent the number of berries Stacy has.
- \( S_{e} \) represent the number of berries Steve has.
- \( S_{y} \) represent the number of berries Sylar has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Stacy has 4 times as many berries as Steve: \( S_{t} = 4 \times S_{e} \).
2. Steve has double the number of berries that Sylar has: \( S_{e} = 2 \times S_{y} \).
3. The total number of berries is 1100: \( S_{t} + S_{e} + S_{y} = 1100 \).

Using the second relationship, we can express Steve's berries in terms of Sylar's:
\[ S_{e} = 2 \times S_{y} \]

Substituting \( S_{e} = 2 \times S_{y} \) into the first relationship:
\[ S_{t} = 4 \times (2 \times S_{y}) = 8 \times S_{y} \]

Now we have everything in terms of \( S_{y} \):
\[ S_{t} = 8 \times S_{y} \]
\[ S_{e} = 2 \times S_{y} \]
\[ S_{y} = S_{y} \]

Substitute these into the total equation:
\[ (8 \times S_{y}) + (2 \times S_{y}) + S_{y} = 1100 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 11 \times S_{y} = 1100 \]

Solve for \( S_{y} \):
\[ S_{y} = \frac{1100}{11} \]
\[ S_{y} = 100 \]

Now, use this to find the number of berries Stacy has:
\[ S_{t} = 8 \times 100 = 800 \]

So, Stacy has 800 berries.",800.0
"First, calculate how many small bottles are needed to match the volume of a big bottle. Since a big bottle holds 30 ounces and a small bottle holds 6 ounces, you need:

Therefore, Jack needs to send out 134 thank you cards.",134.0
"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the number of nickels Val has after taking more from her brother's treasure box, then find the number of dimes, and finally calculate the total value in dollars.

1. **Initial Number of Nickels:**
   - Val originally has 20 nickels.

2. **Finding Nickels in Brother's Treasure Box:**
   - Since she finds twice as many nickels as she had (20), she finds 2 * 20 = 40 nickels in her brother's treasure box.

3. **Total Nickels Val Has:**
   - Adding the nickels from her brother's treasure box to the ones she already had: 20 (original) + 40 (from brother) = 60 nickels.

4. **Number of Dimes Val Has:**
   - Val has three times as many dimes as the original number of nickels she had. 
   - She had 20 nickels originally, so she has 3 * 20 = 60 dimes.

5. **Calculate the Value:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05, so the value of 60 nickels is 60 * 0.05 = $3.00.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10, so the value of 60 dimes is 60 * 0.10 = $6.00.

6. **Total Value:**
   - The total value of the money Val has is $3.00 (from nickels) + $6.00 (from dimes) = $9.00.

The value of the money Val has is $9.00.",9.0

"First, we need to determine how much sugar Lillian has in total:

- She has 3 cups of sugar at home.
- She buys 2 bags of sugar, and each bag contains 6 cups. So, 2 bags give her \(2 \times 6 = 12\) cups of sugar.

Adding them together, Lillian has a total of \(3 + 12 = 15\) cups of sugar.

Next, we need to determine how much sugar is needed to bake and ice one dozen cupcakes:

- The batter for a dozen cupcakes requires 1 cup of sugar.
- The frosting for a dozen cupcakes requires 2 cups of sugar.

Therefore, to bake and ice one dozen cupcakes, Lillian needs \(1 + 2 = 3\) cups of sugar.

Now we can calculate how many dozen cupcakes Lillian can make with her 15 cups of sugar by dividing the total amount of sugar by the amount needed per dozen:

\[
\frac{15}{3} = 5

"Let's figure this out step-by-step:

1. First, determine how much money Alex still needs to save to buy the car:
   - The cost of the car is $14,600.
   - He has already saved $14,500.
   - Therefore, he needs to save \(14,600 - 14,500 = 100\) dollars more.

2. Next, calculate how much Alex earns from delivering groceries per trip:
   - He earns a flat rate of $1.5 per trip.
   - For 40 trips, he earns \(40 \times 1.5 = 60\) dollars.

3. Since he needs 100 dollars in total, he needs to make an additional \(100 - 60 = 40\) dollars from the 5% commission on the groceries.

4. Let \(x\) be the total dollar value of groceries delivered. He earns 5% commission on groceries, which is \(0.05x\).

5. Set up the equation for the additional money needed from grocery commissions:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of Simon's purchase before the discount.

1. Cost of pansies:  
   5 pansies × $2.50 each = $12.50

2. Cost of hydrangea:  
   1 hydrangea × $12.50 = $12.50 

3. Cost of petunias:  
   5 petunias × $1.00 each = $5.00 

Now, add up the costs:  
$12.50 (pansies) + $12.50 (hydrangea) + $5.00 (petunias) = $30.00

Next, apply the 10% discount:  
10% of $30.00 = $30.00 × 0.10 = $3.00

So, the discounted price is:  
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Finally, calculate the change Simon receives when he pays with a $50 bill:  
$50.00 - $27.00 = $23.00

Simon will receive $23.00 in change.",23.0

"First, let's determine how many coconut trees Randy has. He has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. 

Half of the 60 mango trees is 60 / 2 = 30. 

Randy has 5 less than this amount, so he has 30 - 5 = 25 coconut trees.

Now, to find the total number of trees, we add the number of mango trees to the number of coconut trees:

60 mango trees + 25 coconut trees = 85 trees.

Therefore, Randy has 85 trees in total on his farm.",85.0
"To solve the problem, let's first understand the information given:

1. Gladys is 30 years old.
2. Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys. This can be interpreted to mean Billy's age is one-third of Gladys's age (since saying someone is ""3 times younger"" isn't a common way to express age difference, but here we'll assume it's meant to be one-third).

Let's calculate how old Billy is:

- Billy's age = Gladys's age / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10 years old

Next, we know that Gladys's age is equal to twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas:

- Gladys's age = 2 × (Billy's age + Lucas's age)

Substitute the known values:

- 30 = 2 × (10 + Lucas's age)

Now, solve for Lucas's age:

1. 30 = 2 × (10 + Lucas's age)
2. 30 = 20 + 2 × Lucas's age
3. 30 - 20 = 2 × Lucas's age
4. 10 = 2 × Lucas's age
5. Lucas's age = 10 / 2 = 5 years old

Lastly, we need to determine how old Lucas will be three years from now:

- Lucas's age in three years = 5 + 3 = 8 years old

So, Lucas will be 8 years old three years from now.",8.0
"First, calculate how much protein Matt needs per day. He weighs 80 kg and wants to consume 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight:

\[ 80 \, \text{kg} \times 2 \, \text{grams/kg} = 160 \, \text{grams of protein per day} \]

Next, determine how much protein powder is needed to provide 160 grams of protein, given that the protein powder is 80% protein. If \( x \) is the amount of protein powder needed per day, then:

\[ 0.8 \times x = 160 \]
\[ x = \frac{160}{0.8} = 200 \, \text{grams of protein powder per day} \]

Finally, calculate the amount of protein powder needed per week:

\[ 200 \, \text{grams/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 1400 \, \text{grams of protein powder per week} \]

Therefore, Matt needs 1400 grams of protein powder per week.",1400.0

"First, let's determine the original selling price per head of cattle. The rancher was going to sell 340 cattle for $204,000. So, the original price per head is:

\[ \text{Original price per head} = \frac{204,000}{340} = 600 \text{ dollars per head} \]

Next, let's find how many cattle he has left after 172 of them died:

\[ \text{Remaining cattle} = 340 - 172 = 168 \]

The price per head is lowered by $150, so the new price per head is:

\[ \text{New price per head} = 600 - 150 = 450 \]

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he would make by selling the remaining 168 cattle at the new price:

\[ \text{Revenue at new price} = 168 \times 450 = 75,600 \]

To find out how much he would have made by selling the remaining 168 cattle at the original price, we calculate:

\[ \text{Revenue at original price for 168 cattle} = 168 \times 600 = 100,800 \]

Finally, the difference between the amount he would have made at the original price and the amount he makes at the lowered price is:

\[ \text{Loss} = 100,800 - 75,600 = 25,200 \]

Therefore, the devastated farmer would lose $25,200.",25200.0

"To determine the total cost to plant the flowers, we need to calculate the cost of the clay pot, the bag of soil, and the flowers themselves, then add those amounts together.

1. **Cost of the flowers:** $9

2. **Cost of the clay pot:** The clay pot costs $20 more than the flowers. So, the cost is $9 + $20 = $29.

3. **Cost of the bag of soil:** The bag of soil costs $2 less than the flowers. So, the cost is $9 - $2 = $7.

Now, add all these costs together:

- Total cost = Cost of the flowers + Cost of the clay pot + Cost of the bag of soil
- Total cost = $9 + $29 + $7 = $45

Therefore, it costs $45 to plant the flowers.",45.0
"To calculate the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint, we need to first find the total area of the walls and then subtract the areas of the doorways and window.

"First, we need to calculate the maximum occupancy for one building. Each building has:

- 10 studio apartments, each with a maximum occupancy of 1 person.
- 20 two-person apartments, each with a maximum occupancy of 2 people.
- 5 four-person apartments, each with a maximum occupancy of 4 people.

Calculating the maximum occupancy for one building:
- Studio apartments: 10 apartments × 1 person/apartment = 10 people
- Two-person apartments: 20 apartments × 2 people/apartment = 40 people
- Four-person apartments: 5 apartments × 4 people/apartment = 20 people

The total maximum occupancy for one building is 10 + 40 + 20 = 70 people.

Since there are 4 identical buildings, the total maximum occupancy for the whole complex is:
4 buildings × 70 people/building = 280 people.

Given that the complex is at 75% of its maximum occupancy, we calculate:

4. **Fishing Boats:** The number of sailboats is seven times more than the fishing boats. To find the number of fishing boats, we need to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 14 = 7 \times x \). Solving this gives \( x = 2 \) fishing boats.

Finally, to find the total number of vessels, we sum the numbers of each type:

\[ 4 \text{ (cruise ships)} + 8 \text{ (cargo ships)} + 14 \text{ (sailboats)} + 2 \text{ (fishing boats)} = 28 \] 

Therefore, there are 28 vessels on the water.",28.0

"First, let's calculate the total cost of one uniform without the discount:

- Shirt: $7.50
- Pants: $15.00
- Socks: $4.50

Total cost without discount = $7.50 + $15.00 + $4.50 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of one uniform with the discount:

- Discounted shirt: $6.75
- Discounted pants: $13.50
- Discounted socks: $3.75

Total cost with discount = $6.75 + $13.50 + $3.75 = $24.00

Next, we find the savings per uniform by subtracting the discounted cost from the original cost:

Savings per uniform = $27.00 - $24.00 = $3.00

Finally, multiply the savings per uniform by the total number of team members to find the total savings:

Total savings for 12 team members = $3.00 * 12 = $36.00

"Let's assign variables to the cost of each item:

- Let \( p \) be the cost of the pants.
- Let \( s \) be the cost of the shirt.
- Let \( c \) be the cost of the coat.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( p + s = 100 \) (The pair of pants and shirt costs $100)
2. \( p + c = 244 \) (The pants and coat cost $244)
3. \( c = 5s \) (The coat costs 5 times as much as the shirt)

We need to find the value of \( c \).

Start by solving for \( p \) from equation 1:

\[ p = 100 - s \]

Substitute this expression for \( p \) into equation 2:

1. **Determine how many thumbtacks Lorenzo used:**

   - Lorenzo tests 120 boards, and he uses 3 thumbtacks (one from each can) per board.
   - Total thumbtacks used = 3 thumbtacks/board × 120 boards = 360 thumbtacks.

2. **Determine how many thumbtacks are left in each can:**

   - At the end of the day, there are 30 thumbtacks left in each can.
   - Total thumbtacks remaining in three cans = 3 cans × 30 thumbtacks/can = 90 thumbtacks.

3. **Calculate the initial number of thumbtacks in the three cans:**

   - The initial total = thumbtacks used + thumbtacks remaining.

"To determine how much 3 bottles will cost, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discounted price per bottle**:
   - The original price per bottle is $15.00.
   - The discount is 20%, which means you save 20% of $15.00.
   - 20% of $15.00 is \(0.20 \times 15 = 3.00\).
   - Subtract the discount from the original price: \(15.00 - 3.00 = 12.00\).
   - So, the discounted price per bottle is $12.00.

2. **Calculate the total price for 3 bottles before coupons**:
   - Each bottle is $12.00 after discount.
   - For 3 bottles: \(3 \times 12.00 = 36.00\).

3. **Apply the coupons**:
   - Ken has 3 coupons worth $2.00 each.
   - Total savings from the coupons: \(3 \times 2.00 = 6.00\).

4. **Subtract the coupon savings from the total price**:
   - The total cost before the coupons is $36.00.

2. **James's Candies:** James has 3 times the number of candies Adam has. So, James has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) candies.

3. **Rubert's Candies:** Rubert has 4 times the number of candies James has. Therefore, Rubert has \(4 \times 18 = 72\) candies.

4. **Total Candies:** To find the total number of candies they all have together, we add up each person's candies:
   \[
   6 \, (\text{Adam}) + 18 \, (\text{James}) + 72 \, (\text{Rubert}) = 96
   \]

So, the three of them have a total of 96 candies.",96.0
"James initially has 200 toys and decides to sell 80% of them. 

First, we calculate how many toys he sells:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.8 \times 200 = 160 \text{ toys} \]

He bought each toy for $20, so the total cost for 200 toys is:
\[ 200 \times 20 = \$4000 \]

He sells each toy for $30, so the revenue from selling 160 toys is:
\[ 160 \times 30 = \$4800 \]

To find out how much more money James had after selling the toys compared to before he bought them, we compare the revenue from selling the toys to his initial expenditure.

The money he had after selling the toys is his revenue minus his initial cost:
\[ \$4800 - \$4000 = \$800 \]

Thus, James has $800 more compared to before he bought the toys. The answer is $800.",800.0
"First, calculate how much water is in the tank when it is 3/4 full:

\[ \text{Volume when 3/4 full} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

Daxton empties 40% of the total capacity from the tank:

\[ \text{40% of 8000} = 0.4 \times 8000 = 3200 \text{ gallons} \]

After emptying 3200 gallons, the remaining volume of water is:

\[ 6000 - 3200 = 2800 \text{ gallons} \]

Daxton then fills the tank with 30% of the remaining 2800 gallons:

\[ \text{30% of 2800} = 0.3 \times 2800 = 840 \text{ gallons} \]

The final volume of water in the tank is:

\[ 2800 + 840 = 3640 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final volume of water in the tank is 3640 gallons.",3640.0
"First, let's calculate how many articles Helga writes in a regular workweek.

1. Helga works 4 hours a day and 5 days a week. That's a total of 4 hours/day × 5 days = 20 hours per week.

2. Helga writes 5 articles every 30 minutes. Therefore, in 1 hour, she writes 5 articles × 2 = 10 articles.

3. In a regular week, Helga writes 10 articles/hour × 20 hours = 200 articles.

Next, let's calculate the additional articles she writes during the extra hours:

4. Helga worked an extra 2 hours on Thursday and an extra 3 hours on Friday. That's an additional 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

5. In these 5 extra hours, she writes 10 articles/hour × 5 hours = 50 additional articles.

Finally, let's add the regular and additional articles together:

6. Total articles in the week = 200 (regular) + 50 (extra) = 250 articles.

Therefore, Helga was able to write 250 articles this week.",250.0
"To find out how many students are supposed to be in the class, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Students currently sitting at tables**:  
   There are 6 tables with 3 students each, so there are \(6 \times 3 = 18\) students currently in the class.

2. **Students who went to the bathroom**:  
   Sally mentioned that 3 girls went to the bathroom.

3. **Students who went to the canteen**:  
   Three times more students went to the canteen than those who went to the bathroom, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) students went to the canteen.

4. **Students added in groups**:  
   Elliott mentioned that 2 groups of 4 students each were added to the class, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

5. **Foreign exchange students**:  
   There are 3 students from Germany, 3 from France, and 3 from Norway, totaling \(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\) foreign exchange students.

Adding these numbers gives us the total number of students who are supposed to be in the class:

- Currently in class: 18 students
- Went to the bathroom: 3 students
- Went to the canteen: 9 students
- Added groups: 8 students
- Foreign exchange students: 9 students

Total students = \(18 + 3 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 47\)

Therefore, Abel has covered 4 portions of the journey.",4.0
"To solve this problem, first determine how many cloves of garlic are needed to repel each type of creature separately, then sum the amounts needed for all the creatures.

1. **Vampires:**
   - 3 cloves of garlic repel 2 vampires.
   - Therefore, 1 clove of garlic repels \( \frac{2}{3} \) vampires.
   - To repel 30 vampires, you need \( \frac{30}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{30 \times 3}{2} = 45 \) cloves of garlic.

2. **Wights:**
   - 3 cloves of garlic repel 3 wights.
   - Therefore, 1 clove of garlic repels 1 wight.
   - To repel 12 wights, you need \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) cloves of garlic.

3. **Vampire Bats:**
   - 3 cloves of garlic repel 8 vampire bats.
   - Therefore, 1 clove of garlic repels \( \frac{8}{3} \) vampire bats.
   - To repel 40 vampire bats, you need \( \frac{40}{\frac{8}{3}} = \frac{40 \times 3}{8} = 15 \) cloves of garlic.

Finally, combine the amounts of garlic needed for each type of creature:

\[ 45 \text{ (for vampires)} + 12 \text{ (for wights)} + 15 \text{ (for vampire bats)} = 72 \]

Therefore, 72 cloves of garlic are needed to repel 30 vampires, 12 wights, and 40 vampire bats.",40.0
"Tye withdraws $300 from each bank, and since he goes to two banks, the total amount he withdraws is 300 + 300 = $600. Each $20 bill represents $20, so to find out how many $20 bills Tye receives, you divide the total amount by 20. Thus, the number of $20 bills he gets is 600 ÷ 20 = 30 bills.

"First, let's calculate Faith's regular earnings for a week. 

She works 8 hours a day for 5 days, so:

8 hours/day * 5 days = 40 hours

Her hourly rate is $13.50, so:

40 hours * $13.50/hour = $540

Next, calculate her overtime earnings. She works 2 hours of overtime per day for 5 days, making it:

2 hours/day * 5 days = 10 hours

Assuming overtime is paid at 1.5 times the regular rate, her overtime rate would be:

$13.50 * 1.5 = $20.25/hour

So her overtime earnings are:

10 hours * $20.25/hour = $202.50

Finally, add the regular and overtime earnings together:

$540 + $202.50 = $742.50

Therefore, Faith will earn $742.50 by the end of the week.",742.5
"To determine how much Kate paid for all her visits to the Art-museum after 3 years, let's break it down by year:

1. **First Year:**
   - Visits per month: 1
   - Total visits in the first year = 12 (1 visit per month × 12 months)
   - Ticket price per visit = $5
   - Total cost for the first year = 12 visits × $5 = $60

2. **Second Year:**
   - Visits per year: 4 (since she decided to visit only 4 times a year after the price increase)
   - Ticket price per visit = $7 (after the price increased)
   - Total cost for the second year = 4 visits × $7 = $28

3. **Third Year:**
   - Visits per year: 4
   - Ticket price per visit = $7
   - Total cost for the third year = 4 visits × $7 = $28

Finally, we add up all the costs over the three years:

Therefore, Kate paid a total of $116 for all her visits to the Art-museum over the three years.",116.0
"The teacher needs to buy 11 vampire-themed bags and 14 pumpkin-themed bags. The store sells bags in packs of 5 for $3 each and individually for $1 each.

**Vampire-themed bags:**
- She needs 11 bags.
- 11 divided by 5 equals 2 full packs, with a remainder of 1 bag.
- So, she can buy 2 packs (2 * 5 = 10 bags) for $6 (2 * $3), and 1 additional individual bag for $1. 
- Total cost for vampire-themed bags: $6 + $1 = $7.

**Pumpkin-themed bags:**
- She needs 14 bags.
- 14 divided by 5 equals 2 full packs, with a remainder of 4 bags.
- So, she can buy 2 packs (2 * 5 = 10 bags) for $6 (2 * $3) and 4 additional individual bags for $4 (4 * $1).
- Total cost for pumpkin-themed bags: $6 + $4 = $10.

Adding the two totals together gives the minimum cost:
- Total cost = $7 (vampire-themed) + $10 (pumpkin-themed) = $17.

Thus, the least amount of money the teacher can spend is $17.",17.0
