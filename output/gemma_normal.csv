Then multiply that amount by 1000 ml/liter to find the number of ml of salt Elijah gets: 9.6 liters * 1000 ml/liter = <<9.6*1000=9600.0>>9600.0 ml. #### 9600.0,"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the amount of salt in the seawater:**

* 32 liters of seawater * 30% = 9.6 liters of salt

**2. Convert liters to milliliters:**

* 9.6 liters * 1000 ml/liter = 9600 ml of salt

* **Total bolts:**  The robe needs a total of 22 bolts (blue) + 11 bolts (white) = 33 bolts of fiber. 


**Answer:** It takes 33 bolts of fiber in total.

**2. Calculate the increase in value:**

* The value increased by 94% of the original cost: $58,000 * 0.94 = $54,920

**3. Calculate the total value:**

* The house is now worth $119,000 (total cost) + $54,920 (increase) = $173,920

**4. Calculate the profit:**

* Profit = Total value - Total cost
* Profit = $173,920 - $119,000 = $54,920

**1. Find the turtle's speed:**

* The cat is 55 times faster than the turtle.
* Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 55 
* Turtle's speed = 4290 feet/second / 55 
* Turtle's speed = 78 feet/second

**2. Calculate the turtle's distance:**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 78 feet/second * 17 seconds
* Distance = 1326 feet

**2. Calculate James' remaining time:**

* Twice Mateo's remaining time is 2 * (84 - 95) hours = -16 hours.
* James has 11 hours less than that, so he has -16 - 11 = -27 hours left. 

**3. Calculate the total remaining time:**

* Lucas has 84 hours left.
* Mateo has 84 - 95 = -11 hours left.
* James has -27 hours left.

**1. Figure out the combined weight of the first bucket:**

* The 83-ounce bucket is added to one of the other buckets, and the total is 140 ounces. 
* This means the combined weight of the first bucket and the other bucket is 140 ounces.

**2. Determine the weight of the other bucket:**

* The total weight of the first bucket and the other bucket is 140 ounces.
* The 83-ounce bucket is added to the other bucket, so the weight of the other bucket is 140 ounces - 83 ounces = 57 ounces.

**3. Calculate the weight of the remaining buckets:**

* Noah has 4 buckets left.
* The weight of the remaining buckets is 57 ounces.

**4. Determine the weight of the second large bucket:**

* The weight of the remaining buckets is 57 ounces.
* The second large bucket contains 57 ounces.

**1. Find the combined weight of the first bucket:**

* The 98-ounce bucket is added to one of the other buckets, and the total is 160 ounces. 
* This means the combined weight of the first bucket and the other bucket is 160 ounces - 98 ounces = 62 ounces.

**2. Find the weight of the other buckets:**

* The total weight of the other three buckets is 160 ounces - 62 ounces = 98 ounces.

**3. Find the weight of each of the other buckets:**

* The weight of each of the other three buckets is 98 ounces / 3 buckets = 32.67 ounces per bucket (approximately).

**1. Calculate the total apples collected:**

* Each bag had 85 apples, and they had 140 left, so they collected 140 + 85 = 225 apples.

**2. Calculate the apples eaten and sold:**

* Two children ate 58 apples each, so they ate 2 * 58 = 116 apples.
* One child sold 84 apples.
* Total apples eaten and sold: 116 + 84 = 200 apples.

**3. Calculate the total apples before eating and selling:**

* They had 225 apples collected, and 200 were eaten and sold, so they had 225 - 200 = 25 apples left.

**4. Calculate the number of children:**

* They had 25 apples left, and each child had 85 apples, so there were 25 / 85 = 0.3 children. 

**5.  Round down to the nearest whole number:**

* Since you can't have a fraction of a child, the farmer has **0** children.

* Apples eaten: 255
* Apples left: 69 + 255 = 324

**3. Calculate the total apples collected:**

* Total apples: 324
* Apples eaten: 255
* Apples sold: 97
* Total apples collected: 324 - 255 - 97 = 62

**4. Calculate the number of children:**

* Total apples collected: 62
* Apples per child: 81
* Number of children: 62 / 81 = 0.77 (approximately)

**Since you can't have a fraction of a child, there must be an error in the problem statement. It's impossible to have this exact scenario.**
